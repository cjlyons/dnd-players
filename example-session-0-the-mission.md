# The Mission

## Corruption in High Eyry

The village of High Eyry sat nestled in the rolling hills north of the Selintan River, its people growing anxious as the once-pristine stream darkened with foul-smelling scum. Their crops wilted, their livestock sickened, and the elders whispered of an unnatural corruption creeping through the land. When word reached the Free City of Greyhawk, a summons found its way to four unlikely heroes.

## The Call to Action

Zyraxian Dawnscale, a gold-scaled dragonborn warlock, leaned back in his chair at the Drunken Griffon, twirling a coin between his claws. The tiny pseudodragon, Thistle, chittered on his shoulder. "The Lady Titania wills it," Thistle reminded him, flicking his tail. "A creeping rot festers where it does not belong. You must go."

"Tsk. Of course, she does," Zyra muttered, tossing his coin in the air. He caught it and smirked. "Fine. But I'm not going alone."

Sir Aric Valdran, aasimar cleric of Helm, took little convincing. "If innocent lives are at risk, my duty is clear." He clasped the warhammer at his belt, topaz eyes steady. "The corruption will be purged."

Garruk Stonefury, a goliath barbarian, cracked his knuckles. "Foul beasts and corrupted lands? Sounds like a challenge. I accept."

Tess Thornhill, the halfling rogue, sighed dramatically. "You're all far too noble for your own good. But, fine. Someone has to watch your backs."

Thus, the four set out for High Ery.
