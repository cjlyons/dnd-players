# The Gathering of the Four

Fate rarely calls upon heroes gently, and for this band, destiny wove their paths together in unexpected ways. <br/><br/>
Zyraxian Dawnscale had spent years navigating Greyhawk’s underbelly, using charm and wit to climb beyond his humble merchant roots. It was in the dim glow of an alchemist’s shop that he first crossed paths with Tess Thornhill. The halfling rogue had been mid-heist, palming a vial of rare essence, when Zyra, driven by equal parts curiosity and mischief, exposed her antics—only to turn around and con the shopkeeper himself. Mutual admiration led to an uneasy alliance, and from there, a partnership was born.

Sir Aric Valdran encountered them next, though under less amiable circumstances. The cleric had been investigating illicit dealings tied to the Thieves’ Guild when he stumbled upon the duo in a River Quarter tavern, deep in discussion over a stolen map. Recognizing Zyra’s fey-touched nature and Tess’s rebellious streak, Aric sought to dissuade them from reckless pursuits. Instead, he found himself intrigued by their moral complexity. In time, his rigid sense of duty softened enough to accept that sometimes, chaos had its place in justice.

Then came Garruk Stonefury, the towering goliath, whose presence shattered whatever normalcy the group had established. His path crossed with theirs in the aftermath of a brutal street brawl in Greyhawk’s Artisan Quarter. A group of mercenaries had been harassing a weaponsmith for failing to meet a noble’s unreasonable demands, and when Garruk intervened, the situation erupted into violence. The party, drawn by the commotion, stepped in to aid the beleaguered smith.

Garruk, impressed by their skill and resolve, found himself intrigued by their dynamic. Over shared drinks at a nearby tavern, the goliath listened to their exploits and deemed them worthy companions. Seeking ever greater challenges, he saw in them the promise of adventure—and a chance to test his strength against foes far more formidable than hired thugs.

Thus, an unlikely fellowship was forged—Zyra’s wit, Tess’s cunning, Aric’s discipline, and Garruk’s might. Though their motivations varied, each had found something in the others that filled the gaps within themselves.
