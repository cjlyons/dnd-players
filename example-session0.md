# **D&D Session 0: Establishing the Game Before the Adventure Begins**

### **1. Setting Expectations and Tone** üé≠

This campaign will feature a blend of **exploration, mystery, and classic adventure**. Expect a mix of **combat, problem-solving, and character-driven moments** as you uncover the threats hidden beneath the surface of the world. Your actions will shape the story, and your decisions will have consequences.

We will strive for a lighthearted and heroic tone.

3. No PVP. Majority rule on conflicts with the DM being the tie breaker if needed.
4. We will cancel a session if > 1 player can't attend. We will try to work around not having the missing player's character present if possible. We will have one player run 2 characters if the missing person's character is necessary for the session.

### **5. House Rules & Mechanics** üìú

We'll be using the DnD 2024 rules. PHB 2024 classes and origins are all that is avaiable. Tabaxi are the only non-PHB 2024 species that is available.

- **Death & Resurrection Rules**
  - Dying is uncommon, players can be revived back in town.
- **Critical Successes & Failures**

  - A natural 1 is a critical failure. It always fails no matter what your bonuses are. The DM, occasionally with player input, will define an appropriate and hopefully amusing result. These will not be too severe, they'll just add some color. Failing is already a punishment. Review DMG p30 for appropriate examples.
  - A natural 20 is a critical success. It always succeeds no matter what the difficulty is. A bonus may be added as well - heroic inspiration, add a condition to your enemy, etc. Again, nothing too extravagant, just adding some color. Review DMG p30 for appropriate examples.

- **Homebrew Content** ‚Äì None

- **Resting & Healing Rules**
  - **Short Rest:**
    - **Duration:** Remains a period of downtime lasting at least 1 hour, during which characters can eat, drink, read, and tend to wounds.
    - **Hit Dice Recovery:** Characters can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest to regain hit points, rolling each die and adding their Constitution modifier.
    - **Class Features:** Certain classes, like Warlocks and Fighters, regain specific abilities after a short rest.
  - **Long Rest:**
    - **Duration:** An extended downtime of at least 8 hours, where a character sleeps or engages in light activity (e.g., reading, talking, eating) for no more than 2 hours.
    - **Hit Point Recovery:** Characters regain all lost hit points at the end of a long rest.
    - **Hit Dice Recovery:** Previously, characters would regain up to half of their total Hit Dice upon completing a long rest. In the 2024 update, characters now regain all expended Hit Dice after a long rest, allowing for more rapid recovery. ÓàÄciteÓàÇturn0search0ÓàÅ
    - **Frequency:** A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period and must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
