- A being of pure order infused you with cosmic law—perhaps a god of time, a lost modron, or the very essence of the multiverse. Your magic is stable, precise, and efficient, bringing harmony to the battlefield. You rarely act out of impulse; instead, every spell is calculated to maximum effect.
- Playstyle: Battlefield control, defensive support, and unshakable reliability.
- Roleplaying Hooks:
  - Do you struggle with free will, feeling compelled toward balance and order?
  - Are you a living anomaly, trying to make sense of your existence?
  - Do you use your power to maintain reality or reshape it to your ideals?

#### Draconic Bloodline – The Scion of Dragons

<image src="images/sorceror-d.webp" style="float:left;" width="100px" height="100px">

- Your blood burns with draconic power—perhaps you are the descendant of an ancient wyrm, or maybe a dragon’s dying breath left a mark on your soul. Your presence is commanding, your magic infused with the essence of fire, frost, or lightning. Unlike other sorcerers, you are physically resilient, and your magic is an extension of your draconic heritage.
- Playstyle: Elemental blasting, flying through the battlefield, and shrugging off damage.
- Roleplaying Hooks:
  - Do you embrace the dominance of dragonkind, or fear the power growing inside you?
  - Do you hoard wealth and knowledge like a dragon, or reject such instincts?
  - Do people look at you with awe—or fear?

#### Wild Magic – The Chaotic Storm

<image src="images/sorceror-w.webp" style="float:left;" width="100px" height="100px">

- Your magic is unpredictable—a force of chaos that even you cannot fully control. Every spell carries the risk of wild, explosive consequences, making you as much a danger to allies as to enemies. Whether your power comes from a cosmic storm, a fae bargain gone wrong, or the raw instability of magic itself, you are an arcane wildcard.
- Playstyle: High-risk, high-reward casting with insane bursts of magical effects.
- Roleplaying Hooks:
  - Do you relish in your chaotic nature, or desperately seek control?
  - Have your powers caused harm to those you love?
  - Do you leave fate to chance, or struggle against your unpredictable nature?

## Warlock

The Warlock is the ultimate pact-maker, a spellcaster who wields eldritch power in exchange for a bargain with an entity beyond mortal understanding. Unlike wizards who study magic or sorcerers who inherit it, warlocks forge a pact that forever alters their destiny.

Warlocks are versatile and thematic, blending spellcasting, invocations, and their patron’s influence to create dramatic, flavorful characters. They can be cunning schemers, devoted zealots, or tormented souls wrestling with forces beyond their control. Whether you prefer charismatic manipulators, eldritch warriors, or enigmatic wanderers, warlocks offer deep roleplay potential and a mechanically rich playstyle.

### Why Warlocks Shine in Roleplay

- Pacts Define Your Story – Your relationship with your patron is a constant presence, shaping your character’s motivations, struggles, and conflicts.
- Power with a Price – Unlike wizards, who learn magic, warlocks must pay for their gifts. Is your patron a mentor, a tyrant, or something unknowable?
- Endless Character Concepts – Are you a noble who made a pact to reclaim their throne? A scholar who sought knowledge they shouldn’t have? A cursed wanderer seeking freedom?
- Thematic & Customizable – Between your subclass, pact boons, and invocations, you can tailor your warlock to be a shadowy manipulator, eldritch gunslinger, mystic warrior, or forbidden scholar.

### Why play a Warlock?

- You love powerful, flavorful magic with a mysterious backstory.
- You want a character driven by a personal struggle, whether dark, divine, or arcane.
- You enjoy customizing your build with invocations, spells, and pact boons.
- You like playing a spellcaster who feels different from wizards and sorcerers, with magic that is more than just power—it’s a bargain with fate.
- A Warlock isn’t just another spellcaster—they are a story in motion, shaped by forces beyond their control. Whether you embrace your patron’s will or fight against it, your path is your own to forge… but the price has already been paid.

Will you rise to greatness, or will your patron come to collect?

### Playstyles and Subclasses

<image src="images/warlock-db.webp" style="float:left;" width="100px" height="100px">

- Charismatic, deceptive, and influential, this warlock uses mind-altering magic and dark whispers to shape fate and bend people to their will.
- Playstyle: You excel in social encounters, gathering secrets, and manipulating others through magic and wit. Spells like Charm Person, Suggestion, and Dispel Magic make you a political puppet master or a cunning trickster.
- Best Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain (for an insidious familiar) or Pact of the Tome (for forbidden knowledge).
- Best Subclasses:
  - Archfey – Enchanting and unpredictable, you beguile and bewitch with glamour and illusions. Are you a servant of a noble fae, or did you trick one into a pact?

<image src="images/warlock-eb.webp" style="float:left;" width="100px" height="100px">

- A walking siege weapon, this warlock obliterates enemies with Eldritch Blast, enhanced by invocations that make it stronger, faster, and deadlier.
- Playstyle: You specialize in sustained magical firepower, repelling foes, and controlling the battlefield from range. You are a magical gunslinger, blasting foes into oblivion with a flick of your wrist.
- Best Pact Boon: Pact of the Tome (for more cantrips) or Pact of the Talisman (for versatility).
- Best Subclasses:
  - Fiend – You wield hellfire and destruction, feeding off carnage to empower yourself. Does your patron demand ever-greater bloodshed, or have you turned their gifts against them?
  - Great Old One – Your blasts twist reality itself, distorting minds and warping existence. Is your magic truly under your control, or does something else guide your hand?

#### The Cursed Knight (Melee Combat & Hexblade)

<image src="images/warlock-ck.webp" style="float:left;" width="100px" height="100px">

- A dark warrior, clad in mystical power, you wield a weapon infused with eldritch might. You are the champion of a greater force, whether by choice or fate.

  - Archfey – A duelist touched by the fey, you vanish in mist, blink between realms, and strike like a phantom. Are you a champion of the Seelie or a rogue knight of the Unseelie Court?

#### The Seeker of Forbidden Knowledge (Mystic & Scholar Focus)

<image src="images/warlock-fk.webp" style="float:left;" width="100px" height="100px">

- A scholar of the esoteric, this warlock pursues forbidden lore, ancient secrets, and the mysteries of magic. Your patron grants insight—at a price.

- Best Pact Boon: Pact of the Tome (for vast knowledge) or Pact of the Talisman (for adaptability).

  - Great Old One – Your patron is an entity beyond time and space. You perceive glimpses of cosmic truth, but will the knowledge drive you mad?

#### The Tainted Healer (Support & Healing Magic)

<image src="images/warlock-th.webp" style="float:left;" width="100px" height="100px">

- Unlike clerics who draw power from faith, your magic is a gift (or a curse) from your patron. You heal, but there is always a price.
- Playstyle: You specialize in support magic, restoring allies while cursing foes. You’re a twisted guardian, a celestial outcast, or a healer tainted by darkness.
- Best Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain (a celestial or infernal familiar to aid you) or Pact of the Talisman (for protection).
- Best Subclass:
  - Celestial – You wield healing fire and radiant energy, acting as a beacon of hope (or a fallen angel seeking redemption). Do you believe in the light, or do you simply wield it?
  - Fiend – You grant healing… but at a cost. Does your patron demand blood in exchange for every spell, or are you using their power against them?
