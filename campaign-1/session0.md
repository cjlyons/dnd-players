## **1. Expectations and Tone**

This campaign will feature a blend of **exploration, mystery, and classic adventure**. Expect a mix of **combat, problem-solving, and character-driven moments** as you uncover the threats hidden beneath the surface of the world. Your actions will shape the story, and your decisions will have consequences.

We will strive for a lighthearted and heroic tone.

## **2. Player & DM Expectations**

- **How much roleplay does everyone enjoy?**
- **Combat: tactical, fast-paced, or more cinematic?**
- **How do we handle in-character conflict?** (e.g., can characters argue? What about PvP?)
- **What’s the party dynamic?** Are you **working together from the start or forming uneasy alliances?**
- **How often will we meet and how long are sessions?**: 1/week, 2 hours
- **How do we handle absences?** (Reschedule, play without, or NPC the missing character?)

### **3. Character Creation & Party Composition**

1. Ability Scores

   1. We will start all characters with a standard set of ability scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, & 8.
   2. Based on your origin:
      1. Add +2 to one attribute and +1 to another **- OR -**
      2. Add +1 to 3 attributes

- **Build characters together**, ensuring a balanced party with shared goals.
  - Use the [Character Creation Guide](../character-creation.md) to help undersand the process and get ideas
- **Discuss backstories and connections**—do the characters already know each other?
- **Align motivations**—why is your character joining this adventure?
- **Coordinate abilities**—avoiding four rogues and no healers (unless that’s the plan!).

---

### **4. Table Etiquette & Boundaries**

- **Set boundaries on uncomfortable topics** (e.g., phobias, sensitive subjects).
- **Decide how to handle disputes**—usually deferring to DM rulings.
- **Agree on out-of-game etiquette** (e.g., side conversations, phone use, and staying engaged).

---

### **5. House Rules & Mechanics**

- We'll use the DnD 2024 rule set
- **Death & Resurrection Rules** – Dying is uncommon, players can be revived back in town.
- **Critical Successes & Failures** – Natural 1 always fails (critical fail if appropriate). Natural 20 always hits (critical if appropriate).
- **Resting & Healing Rules** – Short Rests restore a "hit dice" of HP; Long Rests restore all HP, spells, & "hit dice".
