# **The Call to Adventure: The Fouled Stream**

As the story begins, your group finds themselves gathered in Greyhawk, bound together by fate, duty, or opportunity. You are approached by a contact who needs your help—**something is polluting the waters near the village of High Ery, a small settlement south of the Nyr Dyv lake.**

The situation is dire: villagers have noticed fungal growth along the riverbanks, and a thick layer of scum coats the water’s surface. Their crops are failing, their livestock is sick, and something unnatural lurks upstream. The source of the corruption appears to be a cave that a nearby stream flows out of.

Your group must travel to **High Ery, track the pollution to its source, and cleanse the stream before it spreads further.**

# **Things to flesh out during/after character creation**

As we begin the campaign, here are some important questions to consider about your characters:

1. **Why are you in Greyhawk?**
   - Are you a local, a traveler, or a newcomer seeking opportunity?
2. **What is your connection to this mission?**
   - Are you answering the call of duty? Seeking a reward? Following a personal quest?
3. **How do you know the other characters?**
   - Are you old allies? Strangers thrown together by fate? Members of the same faction or guild?
4. **What is your long-term goal?**
   - Do you seek riches, knowledge, power, or something else?
