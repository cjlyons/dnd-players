_"Every great invention starts with a spark—sometimes of genius, sometimes of electricity, and sometimes from an unexpected explosion."_

Tinkers are **inventors, mechanics, and visionaries** who see the world not just for what it is, but for what it _could_ be. Whether through **mechanical ingenuity, arcane experimentation, or sheer trial and error**, they constantly seek to **improve, modify, and create**. From **bustling city workshops to hidden laboratories,** from **traveling tinkers' caravans to arcane colleges**, these individuals thrive in environments where curiosity is rewarded and failure is just a step toward success.

While many tinkers **study under master craftsmen, artificers, or arcane engineers**, others are **self-taught prodigies**, learning from discarded blueprints, scavenged parts, and a little reckless ambition. Whatever their methods, all share one thing in common: an **insatiable desire to push the boundaries of what is possible**—even if it means occasionally blowing something up along the way.

#### **Suggested Characteristics**

Tinkers tend to be **curious, energetic, and creative**—though their obsession with invention can sometimes make them **absentminded, impatient, or prone to overcomplicating simple tasks**. Some **pursue invention for the sake of progress**, while others seek **personal fame, wealth, or recognition**. Many tinkers feel most at home **in places of industry and innovation**, though some prefer **the open road, where new challenges await around every corner.**

# **Custom Origin Feats**

## **Origin Feat: Tinker**

### **Skills and Proficiencies**

Pick any 3 that make sense for you back story: Intelligency, Wisdom, or Charisma Skills; Artisan Tools

### **Inspired Improvisation**

Tinkers have a knack for **jury-rigging solutions** out of whatever materials are available. Given access to simple tools and raw materials, a Tinker can **temporarily repair** a broken mechanism, create **a functional (but unstable) version of a common tool**, or make quick modifications to an existing device. While these fixes may not last forever, they often work _just long enough_ to get the job done. These items lasts for up to 1 day.
