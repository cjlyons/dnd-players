# **Alignment in Play: Guidelines, Not Rules**

Alignment in **Dungeons & Dragons** is a tool to help define a character’s **morality, ethics, and decision-making tendencies**. It consists of **two axes**:

- **Good vs. Evil** – A character’s approach to altruism, kindness, and respect for life.
- **Law vs. Chaos** – A character’s stance on order, tradition, and personal freedom.

The combination of these axes creates **nine alignments**, each with a unique playstyle and philosophy. While alignment is not a strict rule, it **provides guidance for roleplaying choices and character motivations**.

---

Alignment **isn’t a straitjacket**—it’s a guideline. Characters can shift alignments, and some may be **more flexible in their morals than a strict alignment suggests**.

🔹 **For Roleplay:** Use alignment to shape your character’s **decisions, worldview, and motivations**.  
🔹 **For Party Balance:** Extreme evil alignments (LE, NE, CE) **can cause conflicts** in good-aligned parties. Discuss alignment expectations in **Session 0** to avoid disruptions.  
🔹 **For Flexibility:** Don’t be afraid to evolve—characters **grow, change, and make choices that can shift their morality over time**.

# **Choosing an Alignment That Fits Your Playstyle**

| **Playstyle**            | **Best Alignments** |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Heroic & Noble           | LG, NG, CG          |
| Lawful & Disciplined     | LG, LN, LE          |
| Chaotic & Unpredictable  | CG, CN, CE          |
| Pragmatic & Self-Serving | TN, NE              |
| Ruthless & Power-Hungry  | LE, NE, CE          |

💡 **Final Thought:** Choose an alignment that supports the story, your character's personality, and party cohesion. At the end of the day, **alignment is just a tool for storytelling—your actions define your character more than their alignment ever will.**
