## Back Story

### Born Small, Dreaming Big

From the moment Zyra could walk, he knew he was different from others of his kind. Smaller, weaker, and lacking the imposing presence expected of a gold dragonborn, he spent his youth overshadowed—both figuratively and literally—by his kin. Where others boasted physical might and fiery breath, he relied on wit, charm, and quick thinking to navigate life.  
Raised within the bustling trade networks of Greyhawk, Zyra was apprenticed to a merchant caravan that traveled the rivers and roads of the Flanaess. He quickly learned the art of haggling, smuggling, and making fast friends in low places. Yet, deep down, he craved more—a grander purpose than weighing coin and managing shipments. He yearned for adventure, magic, and power beyond what fate had granted him.

### A Bargain with the Queen of Summer

One fateful night, while his caravan rested in an enchanted glade, Zyra wandered off, drawn by the sound of laughter and music that no one else could hear. Under the light of the Feywild’s eternal twilight, he found himself before Titania, the Archfey of the Summer Court—a being of radiant beauty and overwhelming presence.  
She offered him a choice: continue his mundane life or embrace the magic of the Fey in exchange for his loyalty, whimsy, and service. Desperate to prove himself and become something greater, Zyra swore his pact, binding himself to Titania’s will. In return, she imbued his soul with fey magic, granting him powers beyond his natural gifts.  
His first companion from the Feywild was Thistle, a mischievous pseudodragon, sent to act as Titania’s voice—guiding, advising, and occasionally nagging Zyra about his duties. While Titania rarely speaks directly, Zyra knows that when Thistle delivers a message, it carries the weight of the Summer Court’s decree.

### A New Path to Power (at 4th level)

Zyra’s newfound strength thrilled him, but as he grew into his abilities, something stirred deep within his blood. The more he wielded Titania’s magic, the more he felt the latent draconic power within himself awakening. He wasn't just borrowing magic anymore—he was creating it. By level 4, this realization would lead him to embrace his own draconic heritage, transitioning from a warlock bound to an Archfey to a true sorcerer, empowered by his golden ancestry.

### Personality & Traits

1. Charming & Kind – Zyra is a charismatic, quick-witted adventurer who enjoys making friends wherever he goes. He trusts easily and believes in second chances, even for those who may not deserve them.
2. Impulsive & Reckless – Whether making risky bargains, taking dangerous dares, or jumping headfirst into battle, Zyra rarely thinks things through—a trait that endears him to some and frustrates others.
3. Loyal, but Stubborn – He is devoted to Titania and his friends, but he hates being controlled. If someone tells him he "can't" or "shouldn't" do something, he’s even more likely to try.

### Bonds & Motivations

1. Fey Oaths & Mortal Desires – Titania’s demands can be cryptic, whimsical, or even infuriating. But her gifts are undeniable. Will Zyra always be her loyal pawn, or will he one day seek freedom from her grasp?
2. Proving His Worth – He refuses to be weak. Whether through magic, cunning, or sheer willpower, he will become a legend among dragonborn, not just an overlooked runt.
3. Curiosity Unbound – The world is vast, strange, and filled with wonders. Zyra wants to experience it all—to see the impossible, touch the forbidden, and reshape destiny itself.
