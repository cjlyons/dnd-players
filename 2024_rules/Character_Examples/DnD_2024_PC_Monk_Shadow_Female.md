# **Background**

She was born in the **Amedio Jungle**, a vast and dangerous land teeming with ancient ruins, hostile tribes, and wild predators. She was raised within the **hidden network of smugglers, assassins, and thieves** who operated along the jungle’s hidden paths and coastal inlets. These criminals, known as the **Black Tide**, ran illicit trade between the jungle’s interior and the pirate-controlled seas, smuggling exotic goods, stolen treasures, and even people.

## **Family and Mentors**

Her true **family is unknown**—she was likely **orphaned or abandoned** at a young age. The **Black Tide** took her in, raising her as one of their own. She was trained by a ruthless but cunning smuggler named **Captain Vargas "The Viper"**, a human with a silver tongue and a dagger hidden in every sleeve. He treated her like an investment—if she was useful, she lived. If not, she would be discarded.

## **Allies and Rivals**

Among the Black Tide, she had a few **close allies**:

- **"Little Fang" (Kenku Thief)** – Her partner in crime, a fellow smuggler who specialized in forgery and deception. She hasn’t seen him since she fled the Amedio Jungle.
- **Jorra "The Storm" (Lizardfolk Brawler)** – A former pit fighter who taught her hand-to-hand combat, turning her into a weapon.
- **Selva Nightstep (Elven Assassin)** – A deadly shadow who trained her in stealth and silent killing.

But she also made **enemies**:

- **Captain Vargas "The Viper"** – The man who raised her. She betrayed him, and now he wants her dead.
- **The Crimson Fangs** – A rival gang she double-crossed on a smuggling job gone wrong.

## **Training**

Growing up within the Black Tide, she **learned survival first**—stealing, sneaking, and running before she ever learned to fight. She climbed before she could walk, dashed across rooftops before she could read, and learned to kill before she ever learned to trust.

Her **true martial training** came when **Selva Nightstep**, an exiled assassin of the Scarlet Brotherhood, took her under her wing. Selva was a master of the **Way of Shadow**, and she recognized the natural agility and raw potential in the young Tabaxi. Under Selva’s guidance, she learned to **vanish into darkness, move without sound, and strike without mercy**.

## **Becoming a monk**

She never intended to be a monk—she was trained to be a weapon. But something changed when she took her **first life in cold blood**. The thrill, the silence, the perfection of the moment when shadow met steel—it was intoxicating. From that moment, she dedicated herself to refining her body into the ultimate instrument of stealth and death.

But it was also the moment she **realized she was more than just a smuggler**—she was an **artist of the unseen, a whisper in the dark, a predator moving through the world unnoticed**. The path of the **Shadow Monk** was not a choice, but a natural evolution.

## **Current Location**

After **betraying Captain Vargas** and escaping the Amedio Jungle, she fled across the **Azure Sea**, eventually arriving in **Greyhawk City**. She now hides within the city’s underworld, working as a thief-for-hire, information broker, and occasional assassin. She has a small hideout in the **Dock District**, where she keeps to the shadows, always watching for the day her past catches up with her.

## **Becoming an Adventurer?**

She never wanted to be an adventurer—**she was forced into it**. When she **double-crossed Vargas**, she thought she was free. But now, powerful people want her dead, and she has **nowhere left to run**. The only way forward is to become stronger, to outmaneuver her enemies, and to **take control of her own destiny**.

## **Current Goals and Motivations**

- **Survival** – She knows that staying in one place too long means death. She needs allies, power, and a way to erase her past.
- **Vengeance** – Vargas and the Crimson Fangs betrayed her. If she ever gets the chance, she’ll settle the score.
- **Freedom** – No more masters, no more bosses. She wants to carve out her own empire, where she answers to no one.
- **Mastery of the Shadows** – She seeks to **perfect her art**, becoming a shadow that even the gods fear.

## **Long-Term Aspirations**

- **To build her own criminal empire** – One that operates beyond the reach of those who once controlled her.
- **To become a legend of the underworld** – A ghostly figure whispered about in the darkest corners of the world.
- **To learn the ultimate secrets of the Way of Shadow** – Perhaps even uncovering lost knowledge of shadow magic.

## **Personality and Beliefs**

- **Pragmatic & Ruthless** – She does what she must to survive. There is no “good” or “evil,” only what is useful and what is not.
- **Freedom Above All** – She despises being controlled. Any form of servitude is an insult.
- **Trust Is a Luxury** – She assumes everyone will betray her eventually.
- **Dark Humor** – Her humor is dry, biting, and often laced with sarcasm.
- **Adrenaline Addict** – She lives for the rush of danger.

## **Quirks, Whims, and Flaws**

- **Always Watching** – She sits with her back to the wall and always has an escape plan.
- **Obsession with the Hunt** – She enjoys the chase more than the kill, toying with targets before striking.
- **Kleptomaniac** – Sometimes she steals things **just to see if she can**.
- **Sleeps with a Knife** – She has survived too many ambushes to sleep unarmed.
- **No Mercy for Betrayal** – If someone crosses her, they don’t get a second chance.
