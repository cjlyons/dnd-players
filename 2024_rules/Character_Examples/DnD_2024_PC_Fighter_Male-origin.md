# **The Lortmil Mountains & The Stonebinder Clan**

The **Lortmil Mountains** are a venerable mountain range in the central Flanaess, forming the eastern boundary of the Sheldomar Valley. Unlike the younger, more volatile ranges, the Lortmils are characterized by their age, with peaks that have been weathered over millennia, resulting in a landscape of both imposing mounts and gentle hills. Notably, the range lacks active volcanoes, though evidence of ancient volcanic activity and subterranean heat sources persists. citeturn0search1

This region is renowned for its abundant deposits of gems and precious metals, making it a coveted homeland for various races. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have established thriving communities here, drawn by the promise of wealth and the natural fortifications the mountains provide. Their concerted efforts nearly a century ago led to the expulsion of numerous non-human and monstrous inhabitants, fostering a period of relative peace and prosperity.

Within this rich tapestry of cultures resides the **Stonebinder Clan**, Durgen's ancestral home. Nestled deep within the Lortmils, the Stonebinders have long been stewards of both the subterranean and surface realms. Their unique expertise in agriculture sets them apart from other dwarven clans, as they have mastered the cultivation of subterranean fungi and surface crops suited to the mountainous terrain. This dual approach not only sustains their own community but also supports trade with neighboring settlements, fostering interdependence among the region's inhabitants.

The Stonebinder stronghold is a marvel of dwarven engineering, seamlessly integrating living quarters, agricultural zones, and defensive structures. The clan's commitment to both tradition and innovation is evident in their daily lives, where ancient rituals coexist with practical solutions to the challenges of mountain living. Their history is marked by resilience, having withstood numerous threats, including the infamous Hateful Wars, during which they played a crucial role in driving out humanoid invaders from their lands.

Durgen's upbringing in this environment instilled in him a profound respect for hard work, community, and the delicate balance between tradition and progress. The Stonebinder Clan's emphasis on agriculture, combined with their strategic acumen, has not only ensured their survival but also their prosperity in the heart of the Lortmil Mountains.
