## **Back Story**

Mazgor the Unbroken is a **soldier without a nation, a warrior without a home**, but his **unyielding will and iron discipline** drive him forward. He **seeks justice through strength**, but **whether his path leads to redemption or destruction remains to be seen.**

## **Origins & Upbringing**

Mazgor was born in the **lawless, war-torn Pomarj**, a land ruled by orc warlords, bandits, and slavers. Unlike most orcs who thrived on savagery and chaos, Mazgor was raised within the disciplined warband of **Warlord Dargul the Iron-Fisted**. Dargul was a rare leader among the Pomarj—he believed in **order, discipline, and structured warfare**, not mindless pillaging.

Within the fortress of **Stonehold**, Mazgor trained in **tactics, formations, and the art of war**, drilled daily alongside hardened orcs, hobgoblins, and half-orcs. His warband was a **military force, not a rabble**, and he was forged into a warrior meant to bring **order through strength**.

Yet, discipline is rare in the Pomarj. Other warlords saw Dargul’s vision as **weakness**. They betrayed him, **Ghazran the Butcher** leading a brutal coup. Dargul’s loyal warriors were **slaughtered, enslaved, or scattered**. Mazgor barely escaped.

With **nothing left but his training and his unyielding will**, he swore vengeance. The Pomarj would **never break him**—he would break **those who betrayed his warband instead**.
