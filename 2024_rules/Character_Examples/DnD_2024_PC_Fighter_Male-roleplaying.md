Durgen is a **pragmatic, battle-hardened dwarf with deep roots in his farming heritage and a lingering sense of loss**. To roleplay him effectively, focus on his **speech patterns, mannerisms, beliefs, and interactions** with others.

- **Use blunt, efficient speech** – “No nonsense. Just get it done.”
- **Describe small, consistent habits** – Checking armor, muttering about the weather, fixing things
- **Make practical, grounded decisions** – He doesn’t take risks for no reason
- **Show his respect for land, ancestors, and hard work** – He values **discipline, tradition, and self-sufficiency**
- **Bring out his humor sparingly** – **Dry, sarcastic, and to-the-point** humor makes him feel more real
- **Let his emotional depth show in moments of quiet** – **Grief, regret, or a deep belief in honor and loyalty**

Durgen isn’t just a fighter—he’s a **worker, a survivor, and a protector**. Roleplay him as **the unshakable foundation of the group**, the one who **does what needs to be done, no matter the cost**.

**"A strong back, a steady arm, and an axe that knows its purpose. That’s all a dwarf needs."**

## **1. Speech & Dialogue**

**Durgen doesn’t waste words.** He speaks plainly, directly, and with a gruff edge. His speech is practical and to the point but filled with dwarven wisdom.

### **Speech Style:**

- **Short and blunt:** “Aye.” “Hmph.” “Fine.” “Enough talk. Time to work.”
- **Practical:** “A blade’s no use if ye don’t know how to swing it.”
- **Dwarven idioms:**
  - _“A dwarf’s word is harder than stone.”_ (Honesty)
  - _“Roots run deep, even in the cold.”_ (Loyalty)
  - _“A strong arm swings true, but a strong back builds a future.”_ (Hard work)
- **Talks about nature and farming instinctively:**
  - _“Storm’s comin’. Smell it in the air.”_
  - _“Soil’s too dry. Ain’t good for planting.”_
  - _“Meat’s fresh. Not long dead. Somethin’ else is huntin’ close by.”_

**Example in Roleplay:**  
_The party is planning to enter a deep dungeon._

- Wizard: “We should map our descent, mark our path carefully.”
- Durgen: _crosses arms_ “Aye, like planting rows. Ye stray too far, ye don’t find your way back.”

## **2. Mannerisms & Habits**

To make him **feel distinct at the table**, use consistent **physical mannerisms** and **rituals**.

### **Small Roleplay Actions:**

- **Grumbles when frustrated** (_“Bah. This is a fool’s errand.”_)
- **Checks his belt or armor before a fight** (a quiet, disciplined habit)
- **Takes care of his weapons daily**, sharpening them like a farmer tending tools
- **Prefers action over talk**, often being the first to step forward when a decision is made
- **Sizes up new people by looking at their hands** (_Calloused hands? A worker. Soft hands? A noble. Bloodied hands? A killer._)
- **Instinctively takes the lead outdoors**, since he’s used to scouting fields and navigating mountains

**Example in Roleplay:**  
_The rogue complains about the long hike._

- Durgen: _Snorts._ “Yer legs ain’t built for walkin’? Try haulin’ barrels uphill after a storm.”

## **3. Combat & Fighting Style**

Durgen isn’t a reckless brawler—he’s a **seasoned, disciplined fighter** who treats battle like another day’s work.

### **How He Fights:**

- **Efficient and brutal**—no wasted movement, just **practical strikes**
- **Heavy, powerful swings**—he treats his battleaxe like a **farming scythe, cleaving through opponents**
- **Survival instincts**—uses **terrain, positioning, and brute force** to overpower foes
- **Steady in a fight**—doesn’t gloat or taunt, just **grits his teeth and gets the job done**

**Example in Roleplay:**
_After striking down a bandit leader with a single axe blow:_

- Durgen: _“Ye step on my land, ye reap what ye sow.”_

## **4. Personality Conflicts & Growth**

Durgen has a **strong sense of justice, duty, and practicality**, but he is also **stubborn, blunt, and slow to trust**. Consider how these play out in different roleplay situations.

### **Internal Conflicts to Explore:**

- **Grief & Shame** – He lost his farm, his people rejected his way of life, and now he **questions his place in the world**.
- **A Farmer in a Warrior’s World** – He knows how to fight, but he **doesn’t enjoy killing**. What happens when **he must choose between survival and mercy?**
- **Leadership Struggles** – He’s used to hard work and discipline, but **can he trust others to lead, or does he take charge?**
- **Honor vs. Pragmatism** – Does he **forgive his clan and return home**, or does he **forge a new path on his own terms?**

**Example in Roleplay:**  
_A village is being raided. The party debates whether to fight or flee._

- Rogue: “We can’t take on this many. We should run.”
- Durgen: _Tightens grip on his axe._ “Aye, we can run. But if we do, these folk lose everything—like I did.” _Turns to face the battle._ “I ain’t runnin’ again.”

## **5. Beliefs & Superstitions**

Durgen is **a practical man**, but he still holds on to **dwarven traditions and superstitions**.

### **Beliefs to Roleplay:**

- **Respects the Land** – He sees **the earth as sacred**—not just stone and metal, but soil, crops, and life itself.
- **Won’t Waste Good Resources** – Whether it’s **food, tools, or weapons**, he hates wastefulness.
- **Dwarven Ancestor Worship** – He believes his ancestors **watch over him**, and sometimes **mumbles to them in private**.

**Example in Roleplay:**  
_The party finds a dwarven ruin, looting gold and relics._

- Durgen: _Places a small rock over a fallen dwarf’s skeleton._ “We take what we need. We leave what we don’t. The dead don’t need coin, but they do need respect.”

## **6. Humor & Lightheartedness**

Though he’s serious, **he’s not humorless**. His **humor is dry, sarcastic, and often self-deprecating**.

### **Examples of Dwarven Humor:**

- _After getting hit in battle:_ “Bah! That all ye got? I’ve had worse scrapes wrestlin’ goats.”
- _Looking at an elf struggling to carry a heavy bag:_ “Ye sure ye don’t need a pack mule, twig? Or are ye the pack mule?”
- _When someone talks about fancy tactics:_ “Axe to the face works just fine.”

**Example in Roleplay:**  
_The wizard explains an elaborate magical plan to sneak past guards._

- Durgen: _“Or, we hit ‘em real hard, and walk through the front door.”_
