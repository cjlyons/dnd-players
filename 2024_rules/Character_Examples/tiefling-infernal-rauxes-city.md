### **What Was Rauxes?**

Once the grand capital of the **Great Kingdom of Aerdy**, Rauxes was the seat of imperial power for centuries. It was a city of **wealth, corruption, and dark ambition**, home to tyrants, scheming nobles, and an empire that slowly crumbled under its own decadence.

For generations, the **House of Naelax** ruled Rauxes with an iron fist—leaders who **openly consorted with devils** and made infernal pacts to maintain their grip on power. The city's nobility grew ever more cruel, and whispers of **demonic rituals, blood sacrifices, and unspeakable sorcery** filled the halls of its palaces.

### **The Fall of Rauxes – A Cataclysm of Infernal Horror**

In **586 CY**, Rauxes suffered an **apocalyptic event** that erased it from the political map. When the last Overking, **Ivid V**, was betrayed by his infernal allies (or perhaps by his own hand), a **massive planar catastrophe** ripped through the city.

- The entire city was **consumed in a cataclysmic explosion of dark magic**.
- A massive **rift to the Lower Planes** opened, unleashing **devils, screaming souls, and eldritch horrors** into the streets.
- A powerful **magical distortion** settled over the ruins, warping time and space within the city.
- The once-mighty imperial armies were **slaughtered, transformed into undead horrors, or vanished into the void**.
- Anyone who remained was either **killed, mutated, or trapped in an eternal nightmare**.

Today, **Rauxes is a cursed ruin**, abandoned by all but the desperate, the insane, and the damned. It is **shrouded in an unnatural mist**, and those who attempt to enter rarely return. Some say the city is **trapped between planes**, flickering in and out of reality, while others believe it has become a **prison for lost souls and infernal beings**.

- **Infernal Lords Staked Their Claim:** The devils who once worked with House Naelax may still be **lurking in the ruins**, gathering power, or torturing the souls trapped there.

- **The Black Gate:** Deep within the ruins lies **a massive portal**—a rift that may still be open to the **Nine Hells** or some even worse infernal plane.
