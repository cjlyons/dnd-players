## Back Story

### Early Life

Finnrick Thornhill grew up in the bustling streets of Clerkburg, a district in Greyhawk known for its scholars and bureaucrats. However, the only education Finnrick ever received was in the art of deception, learned from his uncle Tobias—a notorious con artist who ran a series of elaborate scams on Greyhawk’s nobility. Whether it was posing as a foreign prince in need of “temporary” funds or selling counterfeit spell scrolls, young Finnrick quickly learned the ropes of fast talk, sleight of hand, and misdirection.  
By the time he was a teenager, Finnrick had already established himself as a street-savvy trickster running confidence schemes on unwitting merchants, corrupt officials, and the occasional self-important noble. But he wasn’t in it just for the coin—he had a soft spot for the underprivileged, often redistributing his ill-gotten gains to struggling beggars, orphans, and hard-working folk crushed under the weight of Greyhawk’s bureaucracy.

### Turning Point

One day, Finnrick’s usual routine took a turn for the worse. He attempted to swindle a minor noble with a forged deed to a "forgotten estate" in the Cairn Hills—only to discover too late that his mark was not an ignorant aristocrat, but an agent of the Greyhawk Thieves’ Guild. Captured and facing a grim fate, Finnrick only managed to escape thanks to his silver tongue and a well-timed distraction (some say he convinced his captors they had the wrong guy, others swear he sold them a fake map to a dragon’s hoard).  
Now, on the run from the Thieves' Guild, Finnrick lays low in the River Quarter, making a name for himself as a freelance rogue. He refuses to work under the guild’s strict, exploitative rules, instead taking contracts on his own terms, often favoring jobs that disrupt the corrupt elite. From forging documents and lifting purses to exposing corrupt merchants through well-placed lies, Finnrick sees himself as more than just a rogue—he's a trickster with a purpose, a scoundrel with a heart of gold, and above all, a free spirit who refuses to bow to authority.

### Current Goals & Motivations

1. Outrun the Thieves’ Guild: Finnrick needs to stay one step ahead of the guild enforcers who still want to collect a debt (or his head).
2. Expose Corruption: He thrives on toppling the powerful through elaborate schemes, often aiding the downtrodden in the process.
3. Find the Ultimate Score: A legendary con, a heist of a lifetime, or perhaps a grand scheme to outwit the city’s most untouchable elites.
