Kaelor is a character of **contrasts**—he is both **a disciplined warrior and a free-spirited wanderer**, a **noble exile and a storm-touched outcast**. His **personality, body language, voice, and choices** should reflect **the tension between these two sides** and the storm that **always seems to follow him**.

---

### **Key Attributes**

- **Warrior First, Mystic Second** – His arc should **evolve over time**, making his transition to Warlock **feel natural**.
- **Confident & Bold** – He doesn’t hesitate to act, whether it’s **battle, a gamble, or a challenge**.
- **Storm-Themed Speech & Body Language** – Use **weather metaphors, confident posture, and subtle signs of fey influence**.
- **A Changing Presence** – As he **embraces his Fey power**, he becomes **less predictable, his fighting style more fluid, his choices more instinctual**.

---

### **Roleplaying Kaelor’s Personality**

To **fully embody Kaelor**, consider these key traits in roleplay:

#### **1. Charismatic but Untamed**

- He carries **himself with confidence**, but he is **not refined like a Seelie noble**.
- He is **bold, direct, and sometimes reckless**, though his **natural charisma** allows him to get away with it.
- He can be **commanding in battle** but **laid-back in a tavern**, showing the **duality of the storm—both fierce and calm**.

- **Example Dialogue:**
- _"I don’t need a title to prove my worth, but if you doubt me, I’ll carve my name into the sky."_
- _"A warrior’s strength isn’t in how hard they swing, but in knowing when to let the storm rage."_
- _"The wind never asks permission to roam. Neither do I."_

---

#### **2. A Warrior First, A Warlock Second (At First)**

- **Kaelor starts as a disciplined fighter**, using **strength, tactics, and skill** in combat.
- **The Fey influence grows over time**, making his **movements more unpredictable, his words more enchanting, his presence more supernatural**.
- The shift to **Warlock shouldn’t be immediate**—he might feel **his patron’s whispers** before truly embracing the magic.

- **How to Show the Transition:**
- **Before the Warlock Pact:** He **relies on physical prowess**, rarely talks about magic, and may even **distrust spellcasters**.
- **After the Pact:** He starts **speaking in half-remembered Fey phrases**, his **eyes flicker with stormlight**, and his **voice carries a strange echo when he speaks with conviction**.

- **Example Internal Conflict:**
- _"I was raised to trust my blade, not whispers on the wind. But the wind has never lied to me."_
- _"My father would say I’m chasing illusions. Maybe I am. But storms don’t form without reason."_

---

#### **3. Speaks in Storm Metaphors**

- The **Queen of Tempests influences his speech**, making him **favor storm-based imagery in conversation**.
- This helps **reinforce his theme**, making him **feel larger-than-life** while staying **grounded in his past**.

- **Examples of Storm-Themed Speech:**
  - "The storm never asks permission to arrive—neither do I."
  - "You hear that? The air’s gone still. That means trouble’s coming."
  - "No ship fears the sea until the wind turns against it."
  - "A blade cuts deep, but the wind finds every crack in the armor."
  - "Lightning doesn’t strike twice? I’d bet against that."
  - "You fight like a summer breeze—no weight behind your strikes."
  - "When I hit you, you won’t hear it—you’ll just wake up when the storm has passed."

---

### **Body Language & Mannerisms**

Since Kaelor is a **warrior first**, his **movements should reflect his combat training**, even in casual settings.

#### **1. How He Moves:**

- He **stands tall, naturally commanding attention** but without arrogance.
- When relaxed, he **leans slightly, as if always ready to spring into motion**.
- In tense situations, he **rolls his shoulders or grips his belt or weapons instinctively**.
- When annoyed, his **fingers tap on his belt or table, like raindrops before a storm**.

#### **2. When Speaking:**

- He **makes eye contact without hesitation**, holding people’s gaze like he’s **sizing them up for a duel**.
- He **smirks when amused**, but **his smile can be a warning just as much as a sign of humor**.
- He might **flip a Three-Dragon Ante card between his fingers** when deep in thought.

#### **3. When Angry or Determined:**

- His **voice lowers**, his words becoming **measured and precise, like the air before a lightning strike**.
- He **steps forward**, not to intimidate, but to **make his presence known**.
- The **air around him might feel charged**, as if **a storm were about to break**.

### **Roleplaying His Relationship with the Queen of Tempests**

Kaelor’s relationship with his **Archfey patron** should feel **like an unpredictable force in his life**—not a master he obeys, but a **whispering storm that lingers at his back**.

#### **1. Before the Pact:**

- He **hears the wind speak but dismisses it**.
- He **feels a pull toward storms, but doesn’t understand why**.
- He **may see glimpses of lightning in his dreams, but ignores them**.

#### **2. After the Pact:**

- He starts **using storm-based speech without thinking**.
- His **reflexes feel sharper**, as if **guided by unseen currents**.
- When magic manifests, it feels **less like spellcasting and more like commanding the storm**.

- **How to Roleplay This Growth:**
- The first time he **uses a Warlock ability**, he might **feel it rather than control it**, as if **the storm chose him instead of the other way around**.
- When his **Fey magic grows stronger**, his **normal combat tactics start shifting**, making him **less predictable, more fluid, and harder to pin down**.

- **Example of How the Queen Speaks to Him:**
- _"The wind does not ask for permission. Neither should you."_
- _"You are not lost, storm-child. You are simply unshackled."_
- _"A blade is only as sharp as the will that wields it. Show me yours."_

### **How Kaelor Interacts with the Party**

Kaelor’s **role in the group** will depend on **his evolving personality**.

#### **1. The Bold Challenger (Fighter Mindset)**

- He **takes the lead in dangerous situations**, relying on **instinct and skill**.
- He **tests others with challenges**, not out of cruelty, but to **make them stronger**.
- He **respects strength, not just physical, but in conviction**.

- **Example Roleplay Moment:**
- _"You hesitate. You doubt. That’s why you’ll lose. Again." (Encouraging a hesitant ally in battle.)_
- _"I don’t need to be the leader, but I’ll be damned if I let someone else get us killed."_

---

#### **2. The Storm-Touched Wanderer (Warlock Mindset)**

- After **accepting his Fey pact**, he becomes **more unpredictable**, sometimes **listening to voices only he can hear**.
- He may start to **act on instinct, moving like the wind and striking like lightning**.
- He still **respects his allies**, but they may notice he has **become something more than just a warrior**.

- **Example Roleplay Moment:**
- _"The wind changed. That means trouble’s coming."_
- _"I don’t know how I knew that. I just… did."_
- _"I never believed in fate. But the storm knew I was coming, didn’t it?"_
