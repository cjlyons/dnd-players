## **Distinctive Features & Scars**

- Lean, wiry, and built for speed and agility rather than raw strength
- The scar across her left cheekbone is her most noticeable mark, though it blends well against her ashen skin
- Three claw-like scars on her right forearm—from a skirmish with a goblin warg in the Suss Forest
- A faint burn scar on her left shoulder from an old magical injury
- The notch in her left ear is the result of a near miss from an assassin's dagger—a reminder that she has dodged death more than once

## **Background & Early Life**

Vasara T’sarran was born **on the surface, deep within the twisted wilderness of the Suss Forest**. Unlike most Drow, she never saw the sprawling, decadent darkness of Erelhei-Cinlu, nor did she grow up under the rigid rule of Lolth’s priestesses. Instead, she was raised in the lawless fringes of the world, where survival was dictated by cunning, strength, and the ability to disappear before danger found you.

Her family was part of a **small, scattered group of Drow exiles** who had fled the Underdark generations ago, carving out an existence in the depths of the Suss. These exiles, largely abandoned by their own kind and distrusted by surface-dwellers, lived as **nomads, bandits, and hunters**, taking what they needed from the Wild Coast, the Pomarj, or unlucky travelers who ventured too far into the gloom.

Vasara’s **mother, Zyssara**, was a hardened survivalist who ruled their ragged band with ruthless pragmatism. She taught Vasara how to track prey, move unseen, and wield a blade in the dark. Vasara never knew her father—she was told he had died in a skirmish with slavers before she was born, but it was just as likely that her mother had simply discarded him when he was no longer useful.

From the time she could walk, Vasara was expected to pull her weight. She **hunted**, **stole**, and **learned to navigate the Suss’s deadly terrain**, which teemed with goblins, slavers, and beasts warped by ancient curses. There were no formal teachers—only **trial, error, and pain**.

## **Mentors, Friends, and Foes**

**Mentors & Influences:**

- **Zyssara T’sarran (Mother)** – A ruthless survivalist who valued strength and cunning over all else. She drilled into Vasara the lesson that **“The world is a predator. Be the stronger one.”**
- **Harlan Veyne (Human Outlaw, Mentor)** – A former mercenary who had taken refuge in the Suss after deserting an army. He taught Vasara the **ways of human warfare**, how to fight with twin blades, and how to read people’s weaknesses.
- **Tharrik the Smiler (Goblin Fixer, Informant)** – A goblin who acted as a broker between bandits, slavers, and mercenaries in the Suss. Vasara **ran jobs for him**, smuggling stolen goods and setting ambushes.

**Enemies & Rivals:**

- **House Baen’und’s Hunters** – Vasara’s most dangerous foes. House Baen’und was a minor Drow noble house in exile, hiding deep in the Suss. When Vasara **killed one of their nobles, a young son named Xelvaris**, she unknowingly drew the wrath of surviving family members, who now seek vengeance.
- **The Blackthorn Raiders** – A bandit gang Vasara **double-crossed** when she fled the Suss. They want her dead, and some of them have contacts in Greyhawk.
- **Pomarj Slavers** – Slavers from the Pomarj know Vasara as a **“ghost in the woods”** who has killed several of their kind. Some of them want payback.

---

## **The Murder & Its Consequences**

The turning point in Vasara’s life came when she **killed Xelvaris Baen’und**, a minor Drow noble who had been hiding in the Suss.

Xelvaris was **a sadistic and ambitious young noble** who had fled the Underdark after a failed coup against a rival house. He had carved out a domain in the Suss, using his magic and wealth to control a faction of outlaws, mercenaries, and slavers. Vasara worked for him as a scout and assassin for a time, drawn in by the promise of power, gold, and the thrill of the hunt.

But she quickly saw that Xelvaris was worse than the criminals she had grown up with. He delighted in **torture, cruelty, and betrayal**, ruling through fear rather than strength. Eventually, Vasara **refused to carry out a job for him**—perhaps he ordered her to **kill someone innocent**, or maybe he demanded that she **prove her loyalty by betraying someone she trusted**.

Rather than be killed for her defiance, Vasara struck first. She **ambushed Xelvaris in his own camp**, putting a knife through his throat in the dead of night. She **stole what she could and fled the Suss**, knowing that Xelvaris’s kin or his mercenary allies would **hunt her to the ends of the earth**.

---

## **Arrival in Greyhawk & Current Life**

Vasara now lives in **Greyhawk City**, blending into the shadows of the **Foreign Quarter, the River Quarter, and Old City**—places where people don’t ask too many questions. She does odd jobs, mostly **mercenary work, smuggling, and hunting bounties for coin**, but always keeps one eye over her shoulder.

She has no illusions about morality—she kills when necessary, steals when it benefits her, and trusts only those who have proven themselves **beyond all doubt**.

---

## **Why She Chose the Path of a Gloomstalker Ranger**

Vasara never saw herself as a soldier, nor as a hero. She was a predator, a creature of the wild, one who **thrived in the darkness and struck from the shadows**.

Her experiences shaped her into a **Gloomstalker**, an expert in navigating the night, hunting those who think themselves untouchable, and surviving where others falter. She learned:

- **To strike first and never be seen.**
- **To master the dark and make it her ally.**
- **That fear is a weapon, and she is its wielder.**

Her skills as a **tracker, ambusher, and killer** are not just a means of survival—they are her **only path forward**.

---

## **Current Goals & Motivations**

- **Stay Hidden, Stay Alive** – House Baen’und, mercenaries, and slavers all want her dead. She needs to **keep ahead of them**.
- **Power & Freedom** – She refuses to be **anyone’s pawn ever again**. She wants to carve out her own destiny, no matter the cost.
- **Revenge?** – If House Baen’und continues to hunt her, she may decide that the only way to be free is to **strike first, again**.
- **Find Something More** – Vasara has spent her whole life surviving. Maybe, for once, she wants something beyond just another day in the shadows.

---

## **Long-Term Aspirations**

- **Erasing Her Past** – Either by **killing those hunting her** or **disappearing so completely that no one can find her**.
- **Becoming a Ghost of Legend** – Vasara wants **power, reputation, and fear**—not for vanity, but because **power means safety**.
- **Uncovering the Secrets of the Suss** – There were whispers of **something deeper in the forest**, something even Xelvaris feared. Vasara may one day return to uncover the truth.

---

## **Personality & Beliefs**

- **“Trust is a death sentence.”** – Vasara keeps people at arm’s length. She expects betrayal and has little patience for sentimentality.
- **“The world is a predator. Be the stronger one.”** – She has no patience for weakness. She respects strength—whether in skill, will, or wit.
- **“Morality is for the comfortable.”** – She does what she must to survive. Laws and ethics mean nothing if they don’t keep her alive.
- **“The past is a chain. Cut it loose.”** – She doesn’t dwell on regret. Survival means moving forward, not looking back.

---

## **Quirks, Whims, & Flaws**

- **Always watching exits** – She instinctively positions herself near doors, windows, or shadows.
- **Sleeps lightly, if at all** – A lifetime of ambushes has made her paranoid.
- **Loyal only when earned** – If someone **proves their worth**, she will go to **any lengths** to protect them.
- **Self-sabotaging** – She struggles with long-term goals, often burning bridges before they can betray her.
