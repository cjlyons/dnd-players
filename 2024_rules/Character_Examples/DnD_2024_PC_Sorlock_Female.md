## Back Story

### Born Small, Dreaming Big

From the moment Zyra could walk, she knew she was different from others of her kind. Smaller, weaker, and lacking the imposing presence expected of a gold dragonborn, she spent her youth overshadowed—both figuratively and literally—by her kin. Where others boasted physical might and fiery breath, she relied on wit, charm, and quick thinking to navigate life.  
Raised within the bustling trade networks of Greyhawk, Zyra was apprenticed to a merchant caravan that traveled the rivers and roads of the Flanaess. She quickly learned the art of haggling, smuggling, and making fast friends in low places. Yet, deep down, she craved more—a grander purpose than weighing coin and managing shipments. She yearned for adventure, magic, and power beyond what fate had granted her.

### A Bargain with the Queen of Summer

One fateful night, while her caravan rested in an enchanted glade, Zyra wandered off, drawn by the sound of laughter and music that no one else could hear. Under the light of the Feywild’s eternal twilight, she found herself before Titania, the Archfey of the Summer Court—a being of radiant beauty and overwhelming presence.  
She offered her a choice: continue her mundane life or embrace the magic of the Fey in exchange for her loyalty, whimsy, and service. Desperate to prove herself and become something greater, Zyra swore her pact, binding herself to Titania’s will. In return, she imbued her soul with fey magic, granting her powers beyond her natural gifts.  
Her first companion from the Feywild was Thistle, a mischievous pseudodragon, sent to act as Titania’s voice—guiding, advising, and occasionally nagging Zyra about her duties. While Titania rarely speaks directly, Zyra knows that when Thistle delivers a message, it carries the weight of the Summer Court’s decree.

### A New Path to Power <FUTURE>

Zyra’s newfound strength thrilled her, but as she grew into her abilities, something stirred deep within her blood. The more she wielded Titania’s magic, the more she felt the latent draconic power within herself awakening. She wasn't just borrowing magic anymore—she was creating it. By level 4, this realization would lead her to embrace her own draconic heritage, transitioning from a warlock bound to an Archfey to a true sorcerer, empowered by her golden ancestry.

### Personality & Traits

1. Charming & Kind – Zyra is a charismatic, quick-witted adventurer who enjoys making friends wherever she goes. She trusts easily and believes in second chances, even for those who may not deserve them.
2. Impulsive & Reckless – Whether making risky bargains, taking dangerous dares, or jumping headfirst into battle, Zyra rarely thinks things through—a trait that endears her to some and frustrates others.
3. Loyal, but Stubborn – She is devoted to Titania and her friends, but she hates being controlled. If someone tells her she "can't" or "shouldn't" do something, she’s even more likely to try.

### Bonds & Motivations

1. Fey Oaths & Mortal Desires – Titania’s demands can be cryptic, whimsical, or even infuriating. But her gifts are undeniable. Will Zyra always be her loyal pawn, or will she one day seek freedom from her grasp?
2. Proving Her Worth – She refuses to be weak. Whether through magic, cunning, or sheer willpower, she will become a legend among dragonborn, not just an overlooked runt.
3. Curiosity Unbound – The world is vast, strange, and filled with wonders. Zyra wants to experience it all—to see the impossible, touch the forbidden, and reshape destiny itself.
