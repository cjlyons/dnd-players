## **Appearance**

**Features**

- **Shape:** Softly rounded but sharp around the cheekbones, giving her a mix of youthful energy and gnomish cleverness
- **Nose:** Small but slightly upturned, often smeared with soot or ink
- **Mouth:** Perpetually grinning, smirking, or talking—rarely at rest. Slight overbite with two small, prominent teeth that poke forward just a bit when she grins
- **Ears:** Long, pointed, and expressive, twitching slightly when she’s concentrating. One ear has a small gear-shaped earring—possibly decorative, possibly functional

Dixie’s **Clockwork Sorcery** manifests as mechanical precision infused with bursts of chaotic brilliance. When she casts spells or channels magic, her appearance subtly shifts:

- Her eyes glow brighter, like gears illuminated by golden energy
- Faint, rhythmic ticking sounds resonate around her, as if reality itself is adjusting to accommodate her magic
- Tiny sparks of arcane energy flicker around her fingers—like static electricity meets clockwork precision

## **Back Story**

_"Tick, tock! The world never stops! So why should I?"_

Dixie Tockspin is an **explosive combination of innovation, curiosity, and relentless determination**. Whether she’s **unraveling the mysteries of the Clockwork Weave, crafting impossible devices, or proving her doubters wrong,** one thing is certain—wherever she goes, **adventure (and possibly a few small explosions) will follow.**

### **The Free City of Irongate**

Dixie Tockspin was born and raised in **Irongate**, the **fortified, industrious city of metal and magic**. Nestled among the **dwarves and gnomes** who shaped its identity, she grew up **surrounded by the whirring gears of invention**, the heat of forges, and the constant debate between arcane scholars and master artisans. She was a child of the city's **artisan districts**, where **guilds competed to craft the most intricate mechanisms and magical devices**.

As a gnome, she was naturally **small among her peers**, but that never stopped her from climbing, tinkering, and pushing the boundaries of what was possible. **She didn’t just want to build machines—she wanted them to dance, to think, to sing!**

---

### **Family & Mentors**

Dixie’s family were **renowned tinkerers and artificers**, but not the stiff, rule-following kind. The **Tockspin family** was known for their **wild, unpredictable** approach to invention, favoring **creativity over practicality**.

- **Father – Jorbin Tockspin** (Rock Gnome, Artificer)  
  A brilliant but scatterbrained **arcane engineer** who was **always one invention away from disaster**. He had a habit of leaving half-finished projects around their home, which Dixie would inevitably take apart and “improve” (usually making them worse).

- **Mother – Felbri "Fizz" Tockspin** (Rock Gnome, Clockmaker)  
  The **pragmatic, no-nonsense** half of the Tockspin duo, **Felbri** specialized in **precision engineering**—everything **Dixie** wasn’t. While she adored her daughter, she often sighed dramatically whenever Dixie got **“carried away” with her reckless innovations**.

- **Siblings – None (Only Child)**  
  But she had a **cousin, Snibbin**, who she constantly feuded with. Snibbin believed that "true" invention was about **utility and function**, while Dixie argued that "true" invention should make people **smile, wonder, and sometimes explode (harmlessly, of course!).**

- **Mentor – Professor Bellowick Gearthrottle** (Gnome, Arcane Theorist)  
  The first person to recognize **Dixie’s sorcerous potential**. He had spent decades studying the **Clockwork Weave**, a mysterious, cosmic force of **order and balance** that resonated with the great mechanisms of the world. **He theorized that Dixie was born attuned to this force**, a rare and extraordinary event.

### **Allies & Rivals**

- **Her family** – As much as she exasperates them, they are her **greatest supporters**.
- **Professor Gearthrottle** – The only one who **believed in her magic**, even when she didn’t.
- **Her greatest rival, Snibbin Tockspin** – Their **friendly feud** over invention **fuels her creativity**.
- **The Guildmasters of Irongate** – She has a complicated relationship with them, as they **respect her brilliance but hate her unpredictability**.

---

### **Training**

Dixie **grew up experimenting**—sometimes successfully, sometimes **ending in fiery explosions**. From a young age, she would sneak into **her father’s workshop, steal unfinished projects**, and modify them.

She **didn't realize she had magic at first.** It started with small things:

- **Clockwork toys that moved without winding.**
- **Gears that turned on their own.**
- **Strange, rhythmic pulses in the air whenever she got excited.**

When **Professor Gearthrottle** tested her abilities, he discovered she wasn’t just a **tinkerer with magic**—she was **a living conduit of the Clockwork Weave**, an **embodiment of arcane mechanics and the rhythm of time itself.**

---

### **Current Location**

Dixie recently **left Irongate for Greyhawk**, where she has taken up residence in a **small workshop in the Artisan’s Quarter**. It’s a **cramped, cluttered space** full of half-finished inventions, ticking contraptions, and **a stubborn, one-eyed automaton owl** named **Gimble** (who she swears has a mind of his own).

---

### **Becoming a Sorceror**

Her sorcery manifested through her **love of invention**. It wasn’t a **divine gift or a curse**—it was a **logical extension of her creativity**. **She didn’t “choose” her magic; she crafted it, refined it, and shaped it into something uniquely her own.**

Her first major realization came during a **grand mechanical festival in Irongate**, where her **self-winding music box** played **a melody that no one had ever heard before**—one that hummed with raw, arcane power. The world seemed to **click into place**, and she felt something **ancient and precise awaken in her.**

She had **tapped into something greater than herself**—and she **needed to know more**.

---

### **Becoming an Adventurer**

Dixie **loves** Irongate, but she grew frustrated with its **guild politics and rules**. Her innovations were **too unorthodox** for the traditionalists, and **she refused to play it safe**.

The final straw came when the **Artisan Guilds of Irongate refused to recognize her work**, deeming her "too chaotic." Furious, she **stormed out, declared she would prove them all wrong**, and hopped onto the next merchant caravan heading to **Greyhawk**—a city where **innovation thrives, and rules are meant to be broken.**

---

### **Current Goals and Motivations**

- **To prove herself as a true innovator.** She wants to **craft something legendary**—something that will make even the greatest minds of Irongate admit they were wrong about her.
- **To unlock the secrets of the Clockwork Weave.** What is this strange, cosmic rhythm she feels? And why was **she** chosen to wield it?
- **To create the ultimate clockwork construct.** A machine that **thinks, feels, and acts on its own**—a true masterpiece.
- **To out-invent Snibbin Tockspin.** Because **rivalries make for great motivation.**

---

### **Long-Term Aspirations**

- **To establish her own workshop in Greyhawk**—a place where inventors, sorcerers, and dreamers can **create without restriction**.
- **To create a device so groundbreaking, so absurdly brilliant, that even the Guildmasters of Irongate will have no choice but to recognize her genius.**
- **To build a "perpetual motion machine" that actually works.**

---

### **Personality and Beliefs**

- **Personality:**

  - **Quick-witted, high-energy, and relentless** in her pursuit of innovation.
  - **Talks fast, thinks faster**, and is easily distracted by new ideas.
  - **Sees failure as just "a stepping stone to success"** (even if it’s on fire).
  - **Loves puzzles, riddles, and challenges**—anything that forces her to think.

- **Beliefs:**
  - **"Magic is just science we don’t understand yet."**
  - **"Rules exist to be tested, broken, and rewritten better."**
  - **"The best ideas come from failure."**

---

### **Quirks, Whims, and Flaws**

- **Quirks & Whims:**

  - **Carries a pocketwatch** that she **constantly tinkers with**.
  - **Talks to her inventions** as if they were **alive.**
  - **Uses onomatopoeia** in speech ("Click! Boom! Tock!") without realizing it.
  - **Her hands are always moving**—if she’s not tinkering, she’s fidgeting with something.

- **Flaws:**
  - **Overly ambitious**—often **bites off more than she can chew.**
  - **Easily distracted by new ideas.**
  - **Sometimes forgets "practicality" exists.**
  - **Can be reckless in her pursuit of discovery.**
