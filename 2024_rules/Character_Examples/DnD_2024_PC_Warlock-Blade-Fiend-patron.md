## **🩸 Who is Xeltharion?**

Xeltharion is a **powerful devil from Gehenna**, known as the **Infernal Arbiter**, a keeper of **forbidden pacts and broken oaths**. He is **not a warlord or a tyrant like many devils**, but something far worse—**a collector of debts**, a being whose power lies in **contractual bondage, oaths, and inevitable consequence**.

### **🕯️ Titles & Epithets**

- **The Whisper in the Flames** – He does not shout commands but **slips into your thoughts**, nudging you toward the path he desires.
- **Keeper of the Forsworn Pacts** – He holds **the names of all who have broken infernal bargains**, waiting to **claim what is owed**.
- **The Black Ledger** – His power is tied to his **immense infernal record of contracts**, each **written in the blood of those who swore upon them**.

---

## **🕷️ Xeltharion’s Role in Infernal Hierarchy**

Xeltharion serves a **unique role among the devils of Gehenna and the Nine Hells**. He is **not a frontline warlord**, nor a mere schemer—he is **the enforcer of infernal contracts**, an **arbiter of power exchanges, debt, and betrayal**.

- He **rarely intervenes directly**, instead using **agents and carefully worded bargains** to ensure he always comes out ahead.
- He is **respected, feared, and loathed** by other devils because his power is **absolute within his domain**—even the Lords of the Nine must **acknowledge his authority when it comes to infernal contracts**.
- He is **neither cruel nor kind**, simply **inevitable**—he **always collects on what is owed**.

## **🔥 Xeltharion & House Kaelmont – The Pact That Doomed a Bloodline**

The noble **House Kaelmont of Rauxes** once sought **power beyond their station**, desiring the **favor of House Naelax**. In secret, they **forged a pact with Xeltharion**, binding their bloodline to **an infernal contract of power and servitude**.

### **The Terms of the Pact:**

- Every heir of House Kaelmont would be **marked at birth**, bound to **Xeltharion’s service in life or in death**.
- In exchange, the family received **unnatural charisma, skill in battle, and infernal cunning**, ensuring they would always be **favored among the nobles of Rauxes**.
- But the contract held **a hidden clause**—should the **House Naelax fall**, the Kaelmonts would **owe a greater price** to balance the scales.

In **586 CY, when Rauxes collapsed**, House Kaelmont **tried to flee the pact**. **Zerathis’ father, Lord Evand Kaelmont, attempted to break the contract.** But **Xeltharion does not allow debts to go unpaid**.

- **Evand was claimed**, his soul dragged into the burning vaults of Gehenna.
- But Xeltharion did **not erase the contract**—he **passed the debt to Zerathis**, branding him **the last inheritor of the Kaelmont bargain**.
- Now, **Xeltharion waits**, watching as Zer **walks the path toward his fate**—whether **he embraces it willingly or struggles in vain**.

## **🛡️ Xeltharion’s Influence on Zerathis**

Though **Xeltharion does not openly command Zer**, his influence is **constant and subtle**:

✅ **He speaks in whispers, not commands** – Zer may hear **a faint voice when making decisions**, suggesting **the easiest, most tempting path forward.**  
✅ **He nudges rather than forces** – Xeltharion does **not demand** Zer’s service outright—**he lets him believe he has a choice.**  
✅ **He rewards ambition** – Every time **Zer embraces power, takes control, or proves himself superior,** the brand over his heart **warms, a sign of the bond strengthening.**  
✅ **He never lies, but he always omits** – Xeltharion does not deal in **falsehoods**. His words are **carefully chosen, always true… just never the full truth.**

## **⚔️ The Pact of the Blade – Xeltharion’s Gift**

When **Zer finally gives in to the power within him**, **Xeltharion grants him a blade**—but it is **not just a weapon**.

- The **Pact Blade** manifests as a **blackened steel greataxe**, its **edge inscribed with infernal script**.
- The axe **hungers for the blood of oathbreakers**—each enemy **felled by it strengthens the bond**.
- **The deeper Zer falls into the pact, the more the blade evolves**, becoming **a true relic of Gehenna’s forge.**

---

## **🔥 Will Zerathis Fall or Fight?**

The greatest question in Zer’s life is **not whether he serves Xeltharion, but whether he ever truly had a choice.**

- **If he embraces the pact**, he may rise as **a warrior of Gehenna**, an agent of Xeltharion’s will—a collector of oaths, a warlord of infernal justice.
- **If he resists,** Xeltharion will not strike him down, but **he will wait, knowing all things fall into place eventually.**
- **If he seeks to break the pact,** Zer must find **a loophole in a contract written before his birth**, something **even devils fear**—for what is more dangerous than a man who can outplay a devil at its own game?
