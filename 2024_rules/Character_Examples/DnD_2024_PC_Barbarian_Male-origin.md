The **Crystalmist Mountains** are the tallest and most formidable mountain range in the **Flanaess**, forming a natural barrier between the **Sheldomar Valley** to the east and the **Sea of Dust** to the west. This vast range is **rugged, treacherous, and largely untamed**, home to powerful creatures, scattered humanoid tribes, and forgotten ruins of ancient civilizations.

## **Crystalmist Mountains: Key Features**

- **Harsh, Snowbound Peaks:** The mountains reach extreme heights, with year-round snowcaps and bitterly cold winds at higher elevations.
- **Remote and Isolated:** Few permanent settlements exist; even dwarves and giants build only scattered strongholds.
- **Monstrous Inhabitants:** The mountains teem with **giants (frost, stone, and fire), orc warbands, roving wyverns, and even ancient dragons**.
- **Ancient Ruins & Lost Relics:** Old **Sueloise** ruins lie buried beneath ice and stone, remnants of the empire that was destroyed by the Rain of Colorless Fire.
- **Sparse Trade Routes:** While the **Lortmil Mountains** have well-traveled dwarf roads, the Crystalmists are wild—only a few dangerous passes are known, used by daring traders or desperate armies.

## **The Skybreaker Clan** – Garruk’s People

The **Skybreaker Clan** is a **hardy and fiercely independent goliath tribe** that dwells in the **Crystalmist highlands**, where few others can survive. Their name comes from an old legend that their first chieftain **climbed to the highest peak and shattered the sky with his war cry**, a declaration that no force of nature or mortal could break them.

### **Culture & Way of Life**

The Skybreakers follow the goliath traditions of **competition, self-sufficiency, and strength**, but their harsh homeland has forged them into an even tougher people.

- **Survival of the Strong, but Not the Cruel:** The Skybreakers believe in **testing each other constantly**, but they **do not abandon their own**. If a warrior falls, they must **earn their way back** to strength—but they will not be cast out.
- **Ritual Challenges:** Every aspect of life is a **contest**—from climbing sheer cliffs to carrying massive boulders for miles. **Every meal, every hunt, every battle is a test of strength and endurance**.
- **Stone-Forged:** The tribe worships **Kord** (the god of strength) and **The Steadfast Stone** (a local goliath interpretation of a primal earth spirit). They believe that **to fall is natural, but to never rise again is weakness**.
- **Mountaintop Trials:** Young warriors must complete a **solo trial**, often involving climbing a deadly peak, wrestling a beast, or surviving in the frozen wastes before they are seen as full-fledged warriors.

### **Combat & Defense**

- **Warrior-Hunters:** Every Skybreaker is trained for combat—not just against other goliaths but against **giants, wyverns, and invading orc warbands**.
- **Weapons of the Earth:** Their weapons are forged from **volcanic obsidian, sky metal (meteoric iron), and unbreakable stone**, crafted by wandering **dwarven smiths** who trade their work for the clan’s rare mountain herbs and pelts.
- **Battles Against Giants:** Unlike many goliath clans that serve giants, the Skybreakers **fight against them**, believing that no being should rule through sheer size alone.
