## **Bringing Lucian to Life in Roleplay**

Bringing **Lucian Draevan** to life in roleplay means fully embodying his **curiosity, confidence, and defiance** while staying mindful of his quirks, motivations, and relationships. Here’s how to do it effectively at the table:

### **1. Establish His Speech & Tone**

Lucian is **intelligent, confident, and impatient with mediocrity.** His speech should reflect that:

- **Fast-paced, eager explanations** – He’s a man constantly thinking. When discussing magical theory or a new discovery, he should speak quickly, sometimes even cutting himself off mid-thought because his brain is moving too fast.
- **Sarcastic, but not cruel** – He enjoys **mocking bureaucracy, rigid traditions, and ‘gatekeepers of knowledge.’** If a noble or guildmaster insists that _only licensed wizards can study this magic_, he might dryly reply, _"Ah yes, because knowledge is best kept in the hands of those too stagnant to use it properly."_
- **A bit theatrical** – He believes in what he says, so when he argues or explains something, he should do it with **flourish.** A dismissive wave, a pointed glare, or an exaggerated sigh when frustrated.
- **Selective with respect** – He **respects intelligence and ingenuity, not titles.** If someone impresses him with clever problem-solving or unique insight, he treats them as an equal. If someone wields authority without merit, he dismisses them outright.

💡 **Roleplay Tip:** If the DM introduces an arrogant professor, guildmaster, or scholar who refuses to acknowledge new ideas, lean into **mocking deference.**

- _"Oh, forgive me, Archmage High-and-Mighty. Clearly, the way we’ve always done things has led to staggering innovation. Oh wait—no, it hasn’t.”_

### **2. Play Up His Curiosity (Even When It’s Dangerous)**

Lucian is **not content with what is known—he wants to push limits.** Use this in roleplay:

- **Touch first, ask questions later** – If the party finds an ancient rune or mysterious artifact, Lucian is the one saying, _“Let’s see what happens if I channel energy through it.”_
- **Insatiable need to investigate** – If a spell is cast in an unusual way, or an enemy has an unexpected ability, he immediately starts theorizing out loud:
  - _“Fascinating! That counterspell was unusually fast. Is it a reactionary glyph? Or innate magic?”_
- **Has a notebook filled with half-crazed ideas** – When resting, have him pull out his **arcane journal**, sketching and muttering:
  - _"If I could just weave abjuration principles into an offensive spell… no, no, the stability would be all wrong. Perhaps if—oh, never mind, I’ll test it later."_

💡 **Roleplay Tip:** Have Lucian frequently **take notes** on things, even during battle. If an enemy does something unexpected, instead of just reacting, have him say:

- _“Interesting. I wonder if I can replicate that effect…”_

### **3. Channel His Frustration with Authority**

Lucian **hates institutions that hoard knowledge** and blindly follow traditions:

- **Clashes with rule-makers** – If the party encounters an institution (wizard guild, church, noble council) that insists magic must be “regulated,” Lucian **immediately pushes back.**
  - _“You don’t own magic. No one does.”_
- **Not openly rebellious, but always challenging** – He’s not a brute or an anarchist, but he will **undermine rules that stifle knowledge.** If magic books are restricted in a university, he’s the guy who **finds a way into the restricted section.**
- **Doesn’t break rules for fun—he does it for progress** – If a law or tradition **serves no purpose but control,** he ignores it. However, if it **genuinely protects people,** he might (grudgingly) acknowledge it.

💡 **Roleplay Tip:** If the party has a lawful character (a paladin, cleric, or knight), **Lucian should constantly debate them.** Not to be annoying, but to question their rigid beliefs.

- _“You follow the laws because they are laws. But what happens when the laws are wrong?”_
- _“You say this magic is forbidden. But do you even know why? Or are you just obeying like a trained hound?”_

### **4. Lean into His Social Selectivity**

Lucian isn’t a loner, but he **doesn’t suffer fools.**

- **Warms up to the smart and open-minded** – If another party member shows genuine curiosity, **Lucian encourages them.** If the rogue wants to understand how magic traps work, Lucian gladly explains. If the fighter dismisses magic as “fancy lights,” Lucian won’t waste his breath.
- **Likes to debate, not argue** – If he respects someone, he **loves a good intellectual duel.** A cleric who can argue philosophy? A rogue who finds new ways to use magic? He enjoys those conversations.
- **Slow to trust institutions, but fast to trust individuals** – He might mock wizard guilds, but if the party’s wizard is talented and open to new ideas, Lucian respects them.

💡 **Roleplay Tip:** If a party member **expresses interest in magic,** Lucian should **light up** and eagerly teach them something. But if they dismiss his work, he’ll roll his eyes and ignore them.

### **5. Make Use of His Relationship with Nythra**

His celestial owl, **Nythra,** is more than just a familiar. She is:

- **A silent moral compass** – When Lucian is about to do something **questionable,** she gives him **a pointed look.**
- **His last tether to restraint** – If she ever fully disapproved of something, it would genuinely affect him.
- **A reminder that he isn’t heartless** – While he argues philosophy and risks dangerous experiments, deep down, he cares. Nythra’s presence is proof.

💡 **Roleplay Tip:** When making a morally grey decision, have Nythra **hoot disapprovingly.**

- Lucian pauses, **sighs**, and then begrudgingly says: _“...Fine. I suppose vaporizing them would be in poor taste.”_

### **6. Emphasize His Experimental Nature in Combat**

Lucian doesn’t just cast spells—he **tests** them.

- **Uses spells in creative ways** – Instead of a fireball straight at enemies, he might **aim at a support beam to collapse a structure.**
- **Mutters theories while fighting** – _“I wonder if a stronger repulsion field could make that force spell even more effective… No time to test it now.”_
- **If a spell fails, he’s intrigued, not angry** – Instead of cursing a missed attack, he jots down a note: _“Hmm, miscalculated. Next time, adjust trajectory.”_

💡 **Roleplay Tip:** If an enemy resists one of his spells, instead of getting mad, have him look **excited.**

- _“Fascinating! A countermeasure against transmutation? I must study this.”_

### **Final Thoughts: How to Bring Lucian to Life**

- **Talk fast, wave hands, explain things like a mad scientist.**
- **Challenge authority, mock bureaucracy, respect intelligence.**
- **Be reckless in curiosity, but not malicious.**
- **Debate with respect, dismiss stupidity.**
- **Let Nythra be his conscience when he wavers.**
- **Experiment in combat—always try new things.**

Lucian Draevan is **brilliant, chaotic, and ahead of his time.** He is an **artist of magic, a philosopher of the arcane, and a thorn in the side of tradition.** If you bring that energy into the game, he will **leave an unforgettable mark** on the world—whether as a **visionary** or a **madman.**
