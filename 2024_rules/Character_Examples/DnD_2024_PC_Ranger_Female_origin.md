# **The Suss Forest: A Dark and Cursed Land**  

The **Suss Forest** is one of the most infamous and foreboding forests in the **Flanaess**, lying just south of **Greyhawk** and stretching toward the **Wild Coast** and the lawless **Pomarj**. It is a place of **dark magic, ancient ruins, and lurking dangers**, where few enter willingly and even fewer return.  

---

## **Geography & Terrain**  
- The **northern edge** of the forest is relatively thin and merges with the plains around **Celene** and the Wild Coast. However, the deeper one goes, the thicker, darker, and more twisted the trees become.  
- The **southern regions** near the Pomarj are dense with **thorny undergrowth, shadowed glades, and ancient ruins**, creating a labyrinth of tangled paths and concealed dangers.  
- The **trees themselves are gnarled and unnatural**, many twisted into bizarre shapes as if warped by **dark magic or old curses**.  
- **Patches of mist and unnatural gloom** often linger, even in daylight, making navigation difficult.  

---

## **History & Legends**  
- The Suss Forest is **ancient**, with its roots tracing back to the **days of the Suel and Oeridian migrations**.  
- Some claim that **pre-cataclysmic civilizations** once built temples here, possibly to dark gods or eldritch entities.  
- **The elves of Celene** have always warned against entering the forest, believing it to be **tainted by old, hungry spirits**.  
- During the **Great Kingdom’s expansion**, various warlords and outcasts used the Suss as a **hideout**, but none ever truly tamed it.

## **Inhabitants & Factions**  
The Suss Forest is home to **all manner of dangerous beings**, many of whom rarely emerge from its depths:  

### **1. Drow Outcasts & Shadow Clans**  
- Small groups of **Drow dwell in the Suss**, either **exiles from the Vault of the Drow (Erelhei-Cinlu)** or descendants of long-forgotten surface migrations.  
- These Drow are often **feral, tribal, or nomadic**, living by raiding nearby settlements or hunting in the shadows.  
- They worship **strange and forgotten gods** rather than Lolth, or they follow **no gods at all**, living purely by strength and survival.  

### **2. Bandits & Mercenary Gangs**  
- The Suss serves as a hiding place for **rogues, brigands, and warbands**—many of whom prey on the **Wild Coast** and caravan routes to Greyhawk.  
- Some are **hardened warriors, former mercenaries, or deserters**, while others are nothing more than **desperate criminals** with nowhere else to go.  
- A few of these groups employ **scouts, assassins, and rangers**—possibly where Vasara learned her trade.  

### **3. Goblin & Hobgoblin Tribes**  
- The forest is **infested with goblins**, some of whom work with the bandits or slavers.  
- The **hobs of the Pomarj** sometimes send **warbands into the Suss** to use it as a staging ground for raids into Celene or the Wild Coast.  
- It’s possible Vasara had to **compete with or hunt goblins** during her time in the forest.  

### **4. Slavers & Slave Hunters**  
- The **Slave Lords of the Pomarj** have long used the Suss Forest as a **smuggling route** to traffic slaves into their domains.  
- Small groups of **slavers and bounty hunters** operate here, seeking escaped slaves or fresh captures.  
- Vasara may have **escaped slavery** or had to **evade hunters** in the past.  

### **5. Hidden Ruins & Dark Forces**  
- The deeper regions of the Suss are said to hold **ancient Suel or Flan ruins**, some of which radiate a **strange and corrupting energy**.  
- Some believe that **old cults** once dwelled here, worshiping **primordial entities of shadow and decay**.  
- Vasara may have stumbled upon one of these sites, or felt the **strange, lurking presence of something watching from the dark**.
