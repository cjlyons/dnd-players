Kaelor should **always feel like a force of nature**—sometimes **calm and controlled**, sometimes **wild and unstoppable**. **The more you embrace the shifting, untamed energy of the storm**, the more he will feel **alive at the table**.

To really make Garruk stand out at the table:

- **Make him larger-than-life**—big voice, big gestures, and a bold presence.
- **Lean into competition**—challenge party members to contests, boast about victories, and respect those who stand their ground.
- **Be fiercely loyal**—once someone earns his trust, he defends them like a brother.
- **Emphasize his warrior code**—he may not always do the _right_ thing by society’s rules, but he always acts with his own sense of honor.

## **1. Embody the Storm in How You Speak**

Kaelor’s **voice and speech patterns** should reflect his **Fey-touched storm heritage**.

**How to Speak as Kaelor:**

- Use **storm metaphors** in casual conversation (**“The wind’s shifting—I can feel it.”**)
- Speak **boldly and confidently**, even when bluffing
- Let his **tone change like the weather**—calm one moment, electric the next
- Occasionally **pause before speaking**, as if **listening to an unseen wind**

**Practice by adding storm themes to normal speech:**

- Instead of _"I have a bad feeling about this,"_ → **"The air’s too still. That’s never good."**
- Instead of _"I don't trust them,"_ → **"That one's like a cloud before a downpour—ready to break, just waiting for the right moment."**
- Instead of _"Let's go,"_ → **"Winds are in our favor. Move."**

---

## **2. Use Your Body Language to Reflect the Storm**

Kaelor’s **physical presence** is as important as his words. Use **posture, movement, and small gestures** to reinforce his stormborn nature.

**Ways to Show This at the Table:**

- **When relaxed:** Sit back with an easy confidence, like a storm **at rest before the strike**
- **When angry or serious:** Lean forward, lower your voice, make **deliberate movements**
- **In battle:** Be **sudden and decisive**, like a **lightning strike**—nod once, speak **short commands**
- **When amused:** Smirk, cross your arms, or **tap fingers as if waiting for a shift in the wind**

---

## **3. React to the Weather Around You**

Kaelor **feels connected to storms**, and his roleplay should reflect that. **If it rains, thunders, or the wind shifts, acknowledge it.**

**How to React to Weather in-Game:**

- If it **starts raining**, he might **tilt his face up, breathing it in**
- If **thunder rolls**, he **grins knowingly** or **looks to the sky as if greeting an old friend**
- If **the wind picks up**, he might say: **“The storm’s watching. Let’s see who it favors.”**
- If it’s **too calm**, he might mutter: **“The sky’s holding its breath. Something’s coming.”**

**Bonus Tip:** Even indoors, you can describe **how Kaelor senses the air**—**"Feels thick in here, like a storm waiting to break."**

---

## **4. Make Every Combat a Stormfront**

Kaelor’s fighting style should reflect **his shifting nature**—part **disciplined warrior**, part **wild force of nature**.

**How to Make Combat Feel Dynamic:**

- **Be vocal in battle**—Kaelor would **call out to enemies** and **challenge them directly**
- **Move unpredictably**—describe how he **shifts his stance, spins his warhammer, or feints**
- **Use weather metaphors for attacks**:
  - _“Like a crashing wave—watch closely.”_ (When swinging his greataxe)
  - _“Didn’t hear the thunder? Then you weren’t paying attention.”_ (After a successful strike)
  - _“I warned you. Now comes the lightning.”_ (Right before a finishing blow)

## **5. Show His Growth from Fighter to Warlock**

Kaelor **starts as a fighter**—grounded, disciplined, but **with an edge of unpredictability**. After his **warlock transformation**, he should **become more fey-like, more instinctive, more storm-like**.

**How to Show the Warlock Change Over Time:**

- **Early on, distrust magic**—“A blade’s more honest than a spell.”
- **As Fey power grows, start moving differently**—more fluid, more **unpredictable**
- **His speech becomes more cryptic, as if hearing whispers on the wind**
- **Start instinctively knowing things**—“Wind’s changed. Trouble’s coming.”
- **During dreams, react visibly**—wake up suddenly, eyes flickering with stormlight

**Key Moment Roleplay Idea:**

- After his pact, **Kaelor hears the wind speak**. Maybe in **a quiet moment, he turns his head slightly, as if listening to something others can’t hear**.

---

## **6. Roleplay His Love for Gambling & Risk-Taking**

Kaelor **lives like a gambler**, always **betting on himself, reading people, and playing the odds**.

**How to Show This in Roleplay:**

- Always **wager something in bets**—gold, favors, information
- Occasionally **flip a Three-Dragon Ante card while talking**, as if **thinking about a gamble**
- He sees **combat as a game of chance**—"Every fight's a roll of the dice, but I like my odds."
- Use **gambling language in serious situations**:
  - _“You’re betting against the wind, and that’s a fool’s game.”_
  - _“High stakes, low odds—just how I like it.”_
  - _“Double or nothing? Let’s see where this goes.”_

**Bonus Interaction Idea:**

- If **Kaelor meets another gambler**, he might test them with **a quick card trick or coin toss** before deciding whether to trust them.

## **7. Use His Relationship with His Patron for Flavor**

The **Queen of Tempests** is an **unpredictable force**—sometimes she **guides him**, sometimes she **tests him**, and sometimes she **lets him struggle to see what he’ll do**.

**How to Show This in Roleplay:**

- Occasionally **tilt his head as if listening to the wind** before making a big decision
- Describe **strange feelings before storms**—a shiver up his spine, static in the air
- **If uncertain, mention the storm**:
  - _“The wind says move, so I’m moving.”_
  - _“Storm’s brewing. Time to pick a side.”_
- In **moments of crisis, let the Fey whispers creep in**—a **soft humming, a rush of wind, a fleeting vision**

**Example Dream Sequence After Warlock Pact:**

- Kaelor stands **on a cloud, lightning flashing beneath his feet**.
- A **tall woman in a cloak of mist and lightning smiles at him**.
- The wind **roars in his ears, whispering his name in a hundred voices**.
- _"A storm does not ask permission, Kaelor. So why should you?"_

## **8. Roleplay His Relationship with Other Party Members**

Kaelor’s **interactions with his party should reflect his mix of warrior nobility and storm-like unpredictability**.

**How He Might Interact with Different Types of Characters:**

- **Lawful characters:** Teases them for being too rigid, but respects their discipline
- **Reckless characters:** Encourages them, but reminds them that "not every storm lasts forever"
- **Shy or quiet characters:** Might try to draw them out, get them to take a risk
- **Magic-users:** Initially skeptical, but fascinated when magic **feels natural, like wind and storm**

**Example Bonding Moments:**

- Teaching an ally **how to cheat at cards** (_"For when you really need to win."_)
- **Throwing a coin to decide something trivial** (_"Fifty-fifty? Fair as any storm."_)
- Offering **philosophical insight in a rare quiet moment** (_"Every storm ends, but what you do in it—that’s what lasts."_)
