Lean into her **quick wit, confidence, and charm** while also showcasing her **trickster nature and moral code**. Here’s a guide to making her stand out at the table:

## **1. Play Up Her Silver Tongue**

- Tess is a **fast talker**, always ready with a **clever quip, an outrageous lie, or a charming smile**.
- When bluffing or negotiating, **embellish the truth**—but make it believable.
  - **Example:** If she's caught somewhere she shouldn’t be, she might confidently claim,  
    _“Oh, thank the gods you’re here! I was sent by Lord Marten himself to investigate a possible break-in—could you escort me to his study?”_
- **Use humor** to lighten tense moments, even when in danger.
  - **Example:** _“Listen, you COULD arrest me, but that would be boring. How about I make you a deal you won’t regret?”_

---

## **2. Embrace Improvisation & Theatrics**

- Tess **thrives on thinking on her feet**. She doesn’t always have a plan, but she acts like she does.
- If a scheme falls apart, she **adapts without missing a beat**—even if it means **doubling down on a lie** or making a dramatic escape.
- **Use props** in roleplay: fake names, disguises, phony accents, or "official-looking" documents she totally forged five minutes ago.

  - **Example:** She walks into a restricted area wearing a noble’s coat and casually tells the guard,  
    _“Do you even know who I am? If I have to explain, it means you’re not getting paid enough.”_

---

## **3. Show Her Heart of Gold**

- Tess is not just in it for the gold—she **helps the underdog**.
- She might **give stolen goods to beggars**, slip a few extra coins to a struggling merchant, or **con a corrupt noble out of their wealth** and distribute it among the poor.
- When confronted about her questionable methods, she could defend herself with:
  - _“The law protects the rich. I protect the people they trample over.”_
  - _“I never steal from honest folk. Just the ones who deserve it.”_

---

## **4. Play Up Her Independent Streak**

- Tess **hates being told what to do**, especially by those in power. The **Thieves’ Guild tried to control her, and she refused**—this makes her **fiercely independent**.
- She works with the party because she **chooses to, not because she has to**.
- If someone tries to give her orders, she might respond with:
  - _“Aww, that’s cute. You think I take orders.”_
  - _“You want my help? You ask nicely.”_

---

## **5. Leverage Her Greyhawk Connections**

- Tess **knows people**—and people know Tess. She might have **past cons, old rivals, or allies in unexpected places**.
- Whenever the party enters a new area, you can ask the DM:
  - _“Would I know a fence around here?”_
  - _“Didn’t I once swindle a noble in this part of town?”_
- If a situation looks dire, she might suddenly **remember an "old friend" (real or fake)** to get her out of it.

---

## **6. Keep Her On The Move**

- Tess **hates staying in one place too long**—especially if the Thieves’ Guild is after her.
- If the party starts settling in somewhere, she might get restless and push for **new jobs, new schemes, or just a change of scenery**.
- She could always be **on the lookout for the “ultimate score”**, dropping rumors or hints about legendary treasures, a perfect con, or one last heist.

---

## **7. Use Signature Catchphrases or Habits**

To make her feel distinct, give Tess some **recurring mannerisms**:

- **A favorite alias** (like “Lady Thorn” or “Mistress Verity”).
- A **coin trick** she absentmindedly performs when thinking.
- A **signature phrase** like:
  - _“Trust me.”_
  - _“It’s not lying if they believe it.”_
  - _“Let’s just call it… creative accounting.”_
  - _“Rules are just suggestions rich people write down.”_

---

## **Final Touch: A Chaotic Yet Lovable Energy**

- Tess isn’t a **malicious** trickster—she’s **playful, cunning, and fun**.
- She’s the kind of rogue who **breaks into a noble’s mansion, steals their wine, and then leaves a thank-you note**.
- She’s a **risk-taker**—but when things get serious, she’ll have the party’s backs.

## **Bonus: Sample Roleplay Snippet**

**DM:** The merchant crosses his arms. "This contract bears Lord Eltan's signature, but I've never seen him use this seal before."

**Tess (grinning):** _“Oh, that’s because it’s his **new** seal! Just had it commissioned last week. I mean, between us, I think it’s hideous, but who am I to judge?”_

**DM:** He frowns. "And you’re saying Lord Eltan himself sent you?"

**Tess (leaning in conspiratorially):** _“Listen, I probably shouldn’t be telling you this, but there’s been a lot of forgery going around lately. That’s why I’m here. To make sure **you’re not getting scammed.** Lucky for you, this one’s the real deal.”_
