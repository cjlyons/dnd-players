## **Background**

Ragnar Wavebreaker is **a storm given form—a warrior of wind, water, and raw, untamed energy**. He laughs in the face of danger, fights with the power of the tempest, and **never stops moving, never stops searching, never stops fighting**.

His **clan may be gone**, but **the storm is still with him**.

And until he finds the truth, **he will keep riding the winds—toward adventure, battle, and legend.**

### **Early life**

Ragnar was born among the **Stormcallers**, a nomadic Goliath clan that sailed the **Azure Sea**, believing that mastery over the storm and tides granted dominion over one’s own fate. His people were known as **storm-dancers, warriors, and wayfarers**, forever chasing the horizon and living in harmony with the raging sea.

Their home was not a city or an island, but their **great fleet of storm-hardened ships**, ever drifting, ever moving. Ragnar’s childhood was spent **racing across slick wooden decks, training under the crash of waves, and leaping from ship to ship as if the ocean itself was his playground**.

But the **Stormcallers are gone now.**

One night, a **great storm swallowed Ragnar’s fleet**, ripping sails from their masts and dragging ships beneath the waves. When Ragnar awoke, he was **alone on the shores of the Azure Sea, battered and bloodied, with no sign of his kin**.

Now stranded **near the Free City of Greyhawk**, Ragnar has been forced to **trade the boundless sea for the city's crowded docks**, working as a **dockside enforcer** while searching for answers about what happened to his people.

---

### **Family and mentors**

Ragnar was raised by **the crew of The Sky Serpent, the flagship of the Stormcallers**, and trained in both **martial combat and the art of the storm-dance**. Among his greatest influences were:

- **Garron the Gale (Father)** – A storm-wielding warrior who believed **strength was found in movement, not in stillness**. He trained Ragnar to **fight like the wind—quick, relentless, and impossible to catch**.
- **Marra Wavebreaker (Mother)** – A fearless navigator and shipmistress, she taught Ragnar to **read the sea, understand the tides, and trust his instincts**.
- **Old Tyval the Storm-Fist (Mentor)** – A grizzled ex-pirate who turned to the **monastic study of storm and body**, showing Ragnar how to **harness his inner energy like a brewing tempest**.

Their fate is unknown. **Did they perish in the storm? Were they taken? Did something greater claim them?**

---

### **Allies and Rivals**

- **His Lost Clan** – Ragnar **refuses to believe** the Stormcallers are gone. He will search until he finds the truth.
- **The Thrill of the Journey** – Ragnar doesn’t just want answers; he wants **adventure, battle, and glory**.
- **Rivals & Enemies** – Ragnar has made enemies among the **Sea Princes**, the pirate lords of the Azure Sea, after leading a raid against them. He suspects they may have had a hand in the Stormcallers’ disappearance.
- **A Missing Friend – Kaelos Tideborn** – His childhood companion vanished **alongside the fleet**, but Ragnar swears he felt Kaelos’ presence in the wind just before the storm struck. Is he alive? Is he calling to Ragnar?

---

### **Training**

Ragnar’s **martial training was never in a monastery—it was on the decks of a moving ship**, balancing on slick wood while dodging swinging masts and sword strikes. His people had no weapons stronger than **their own bodies**, trained to **strike with the force of crashing waves and move with the unpredictability of a storm**.

He learned through **brawling with pirates, outmaneuvering slavers, and testing himself against the fury of nature itself**.

---

### **Current Location**

Ragnar now calls **Greyhawk’s docks home**, working as a **dockside enforcer**, breaking up fights and running protection for merchants. It’s **not the sea, but it pays enough to keep him afloat** while he searches for **leads on the storm that took his people**.

---

### **Becoming a monk**

Ragnar never **chose** the path of a monk—it **chose him**.

One of his last memories before the fleet vanished was **standing at the bow of his ship, fists clenched, staring down the storm itself**. The waves crashed, the wind howled, but **Ragnar did not yield**.

When the storm took everything, his body and mind became his **only weapons, his only ship, his only armor**.

Now, he fights like the storm itself—**erratic, unstoppable, and impossible to contain**.

---

### **Becoming an Adventurer**

- **He must uncover the truth behind the great storm that swallowed his people.**
- **He’s heard whispers of an ancient power buried beneath the Azure Sea.** If the legends are true, it may be tied to the storm.
- **His enemies are still out there.** The Sea Princes want him dead, and he doesn’t intend to make it easy for them.
- **He refuses to stand still.** If life is a storm, Ragnar will ride it to the very end.

---

### **Current Goals and Motivations**

1. **Find His Lost Fleet** – Did the Stormcallers perish, or were they taken? The ocean holds its secrets, and Ragnar means to uncover them.
2. **Reclaim His Legacy** – He may be stranded now, but one day, he will stand as **the fiercest Stormcaller to ever sail the Azure Sea**.
3. **Build a New Crew** – A warrior is nothing without comrades. Ragnar is searching for **a new band of adventurers**—not just allies, but a **crew he can call his own**.
4. **Set Sail Again** – Greyhawk’s docks are temporary. Ragnar **belongs on the waves**.

---

### **Long-Term Aspirations**

- **Command His Own Ship and Fleet** – Ragnar doesn’t just want to return to the sea—he wants to **carve his own legend into the tides**.
- **Discover the Truth of the Stormcallers’ Fate** – The Azure Sea whispers secrets to those who listen. Ragnar intends to **hear them all**.
- **Challenge the Sea Princes** – The pirate lords rule the seas **through fear and cruelty**. One day, Ragnar will **break their power and take their place as a true master of the storm**.

---

### **Personality and Beliefs**

- **Larger Than Life** – Ragnar laughs loudly, fights fiercely, and **lives like a storm given flesh**.
- **Freedom Above All** – He despises **tyrants, slavers, and anyone who chains others down**.
- **The Sea is His Temple** – He **prays with his fists, his laughter, and his movement**, not in quiet reflection.
- **No One Stands Alone** – The strongest warriors are those with a **crew at their back**.

---

### **Quirks, Whims, and Flaws**

- **Restless Without the Sea** – Ragnar **hates being landlocked** and gets reckless when he’s been away from the water too long.
- **Loves a Good Fight** – Whether it’s a **brawl, a race, or a drinking contest, Ragnar never backs down**.
- **Easily Bored** – If nothing exciting is happening, he’ll **stir up his own trouble**—sometimes to his detriment.
- **Hates Being Told What to Do** – He’ll **challenge authority figures on instinct**, even when it’d be smarter not to.
- **The Storm Calls to Him** – He sometimes **hears whispers on the wind**, calling him back to the sea. He doesn’t know **if it’s his past or his destiny—but it’s coming**.
