### Early Life

Tess Thornhill grew up in the bustling streets of Clerkburg, a district in Greyhawk known for its scholars and bureaucrats. However, the only education Tess ever received was in the art of deception, learned from his uncle Tobias—a notorious con artist who ran a series of elaborate scams on Greyhawk’s nobility. Whether it was posing as a foreign prince in need of “temporary” funds or selling counterfeit spell scrolls, young Tess quickly learned the ropes of fast talk, sleight of hand, and misdirection.  
By the time she was a teenager, Tess had already established herself as a street-savvy trickster running confidence schemes on unwitting merchants, corrupt officials, and the occasional self-important noble. But she wasn’t in it just for the coin—she had a soft spot for the underprivileged, often redistributing her ill-gotten gains to struggling beggars, orphans, and hard-working folk crushed under the weight of Greyhawk’s bureaucracy.

### Turning Point

One day, Tess’s usual routine took a turn for the worse. She attempted to swindle a minor noble with a forged deed to a "forgotten estate" in the Cairn Hills—only to discover too late that her mark was not an ignorant aristocrat, but an agent of the Greyhawk Thieves’ Guild. Captured and facing a grim fate, Tess only managed to escape thanks to her silver tongue and a well-timed distraction (some say she convinced her captors they had the wrong guy, others swear she sold them a fake map to a dragon’s hoard).  
Now, on the run from the Thieves' Guild, Tess lays low in the River Quarter, making a name for herself as a freelance rogue. She refuses to work under the guild’s strict, exploitative rules, instead taking contracts on her own terms, often favoring jobs that disrupt the corrupt elite. From forging documents and lifting purses to exposing corrupt merchants through well-placed lies, Tess sees herself as more than just a rogue—she's a trickster with a purpose, a scoundrel with a heart of gold, and above all, a free spirit who refuses to bow to authority.

### Current Goals & Motivations

1. Outrun the Thieves’ Guild: Tess needs to stay one step ahead of the guild enforcers who still want to collect a debt (or her head).
2. Expose Corruption: She thrives on toppling the powerful through elaborate schemes, often aiding the downtrodden in the process.
3. Find the Ultimate Score: A legendary con, a heist of a lifetime, or perhaps a grand scheme to outwit the city’s most untouchable elites.

### Bringing **Tess Thornhill** to life in roleplay

Lean into her **quick wit, confidence, and charm** while also showcasing her **trickster nature and moral code**. Here’s a guide to making her stand out at the table:

---

#### **1. Play Up Her Silver Tongue**

- Tess is a **fast talker**, always ready with a **clever quip, an outrageous lie, or a charming smile**.
- When bluffing or negotiating, **embellish the truth**—but make it believable.
  - **Example:** If she's caught somewhere she shouldn’t be, she might confidently claim,  
    _“Oh, thank the gods you’re here! I was sent by Lord Marten himself to investigate a possible break-in—could you escort me to his study?”_
- **Use humor** to lighten tense moments, even when in danger.
  - **Example:** _“Listen, you COULD arrest me, but that would be boring. How about I make you a deal you won’t regret?”_

---

#### **2. Embrace Improvisation & Theatrics**

- Tess **thrives on thinking on her feet**. She doesn’t always have a plan, but she acts like she does.
- If a scheme falls apart, she **adapts without missing a beat**—even if it means **doubling down on a lie** or making a dramatic escape.
- **Use props** in roleplay: fake names, disguises, phony accents, or "official-looking" documents she totally forged five minutes ago.

  - **Example:** She walks into a restricted area wearing a noble’s coat and casually tells the guard,  
    _“Do you even know who I am? If I have to explain, it means you’re not getting paid enough.”_

---

#### **3. Show Her Heart of Gold**

- Tess is not just in it for the gold—she **helps the underdog**.
- She might **give stolen goods to beggars**, slip a few extra coins to a struggling merchant, or **con a corrupt noble out of their wealth** and distribute it among the poor.
- When confronted about her questionable methods, she could defend herself with:
  - _“The law protects the rich. I protect the people they trample over.”_
  - _“I never steal from honest folk. Just the ones who deserve it.”_

---

#### **4. Play Up Her Independent Streak**

- Tess **hates being told what to do**, especially by those in power. The **Thieves’ Guild tried to control her, and she refused**—this makes her **fiercely independent**.
- She works with the party because she **chooses to, not because she has to**.
- If someone tries to give her orders, she might respond with:
  - _“Aww, that’s cute. You think I take orders.”_
  - _“You want my help? You ask nicely.”_

---

#### **5. Leverage Her Greyhawk Connections**

- Tess **knows people**—and people know Tess. She might have **past cons, old rivals, or allies in unexpected places**.
- Whenever the party enters a new area, you can ask the DM:
  - _“Would I know a fence around here?”_
  - _“Didn’t I once swindle a noble in this part of town?”_
- If a situation looks dire, she might suddenly **remember an "old friend" (real or fake)** to get her out of it.

---

#### **6. Keep Her On The Move**

- Tess **hates staying in one place too long**—especially if the Thieves’ Guild is after her.
- If the party starts settling in somewhere, she might get restless and push for **new jobs, new schemes, or just a change of scenery**.
- She could always be **on the lookout for the “ultimate score”**, dropping rumors or hints about legendary treasures, a perfect con, or one last heist.

---

#### **7. Use Signature Catchphrases or Habits**

To make her feel distinct, give Tess some **recurring mannerisms**:

- **A favorite alias** (like “Lady Thorn” or “Mistress Verity”).
- A **coin trick** she absentmindedly performs when thinking.
- A **signature phrase** like:
  - _“Trust me.”_
  - _“It’s not lying if they believe it.”_
  - _“Let’s just call it… creative accounting.”_
  - _“Rules are just suggestions rich people write down.”_

---

#### **Final Touch: A Chaotic Yet Lovable Energy**

- Tess isn’t a **malicious** trickster—she’s **playful, cunning, and fun**.
- She’s the kind of rogue who **breaks into a noble’s mansion, steals their wine, and then leaves a thank-you note**.
- She’s a **risk-taker**—but when things get serious, she’ll have the party’s backs.

---

#### **Bonus: Sample Roleplay Snippet**

**DM:** The merchant crosses his arms. "This contract bears Lord Eltan's signature, but I've never seen him use this seal before."

**Tess (grinning):** _“Oh, that’s because it’s his **new** seal! Just had it commissioned last week. I mean, between us, I think it’s hideous, but who am I to judge?”_

**DM:** He frowns. "And you’re saying Lord Eltan himself sent you?"

**Tess (leaning in conspiratorially):** _“Listen, I probably shouldn’t be telling you this, but there’s been a lot of forgery going around lately. That’s why I’m here. To make sure **you’re not getting scammed.** Lucky for you, this one’s the real deal.”_
