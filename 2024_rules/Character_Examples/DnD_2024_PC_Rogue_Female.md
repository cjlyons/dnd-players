### **Early Life**

Tess Thornhill grew up in the bustling streets of Clerkburg, a district in Greyhawk known for its scholars and bureaucrats. However, the only education Tess ever received was in the art of deception, learned from his uncle Tobias—a notorious con artist who ran a series of elaborate scams on Greyhawk’s nobility. Whether it was posing as a foreign prince in need of “temporary” funds or selling counterfeit spell scrolls, young Tess quickly learned the ropes of fast talk, sleight of hand, and misdirection.  
By the time she was a teenager, Tess had already established herself as a street-savvy trickster running confidence schemes on unwitting merchants, corrupt officials, and the occasional self-important noble. But she wasn’t in it just for the coin—she had a soft spot for the underprivileged, often redistributing her ill-gotten gains to struggling beggars, orphans, and hard-working folk crushed under the weight of Greyhawk’s bureaucracy.

### **Turning Point**

One day, Tess’s usual routine took a turn for the worse. She attempted to swindle a minor noble with a forged deed to a "forgotten estate" in the Cairn Hills—only to discover too late that her mark was not an ignorant aristocrat, but an agent of the Greyhawk Thieves’ Guild. Captured and facing a grim fate, Tess only managed to escape thanks to her silver tongue and a well-timed distraction (some say she convinced her captors they had the wrong guy, others swear she sold them a fake map to a dragon’s hoard).  
Now, on the run from the Thieves' Guild, Tess lays low in the River Quarter, making a name for herself as a freelance rogue. She refuses to work under the guild’s strict, exploitative rules, instead taking contracts on her own terms, often favoring jobs that disrupt the corrupt elite. From forging documents and lifting purses to exposing corrupt merchants through well-placed lies, Tess sees herself as more than just a rogue—she's a trickster with a purpose, a scoundrel with a heart of gold, and above all, a free spirit who refuses to bow to authority.

### **Family & Mentors**

#### **Family**

- **Uncle Tobias "Toby" Thornhill (Mentor, Charlatan, Con Artist)**

  - A **legendary swindler** in Greyhawk’s underworld, Tobias raised Tess after her parents died or vanished.
  - He taught her **everything she knows** about cons, forgeries, and fast-talking.
  - Eventually **betrayed Tess** by selling her out to the Thieves’ Guild to settle his own debts.
  - **Status:** **Missing.** No one knows where he went, but rumors say he fled Greyhawk or is hiding under the guild’s protection. Tess isn’t sure if she wants revenge or just answers.

- **Marla & Jeren Thornhill (Parents, Deceased?)**

  - Honest **street vendors** in Greyhawk who tried to make a living selling baked goods and simple wares.
  - They **fell into debt** with dangerous people—possibly nobles or criminals—and **vanished mysteriously**.
  - Tess suspects the **Thieves’ Guild or a corrupt noble had them silenced** for failing to pay.
  - This fuels her **hatred of unchecked power** and her **desire to expose corruption**.

- **Eddie “Lucky” Thornhill (Older Brother, Missing)**
  - A **former gambler and rogue** who disappeared years ago after a failed scam.
  - Tess looked up to him as a kid—he was **charming and reckless** but always **protected her**.
  - He **might be alive, working for the Guild, in prison, or worse**. If she finds him, she’ll want to know what happened.

- **Father Orlin Greaves (Priest of Olidammara, Rogue Ally)**

  - A **former thief-turned-cleric** who runs a **sanctuary for scoundrels** in Greyhawk.
  - He taught Tess the **value of subtlety and patience** rather than reckless thievery.
  - He **disapproves of her arrogance** but **sees potential in her** as a force for good.
  - If Tess **ever needs to disappear or hide**, Father Orlin’s sanctuary is one of her last safe havens.

- **Sergeant Lann Vosk (City Watch Officer, Reluctant Ally)**
  - A **straight-laced but fair guard** who’s **caught Tess before but let her go**.
  - He believes she could be **a force for good** but **hates her criminal methods**.
  - If she’s in trouble, **he might help—begrudgingly.**
  - He might even offer her **a chance to turn things around**… if she’d just stop **conning people**.

### **Friends & Allies**

- **Cass "Quickhands" Dalwyn (Halfling Burglar, Best Friend)**

  - A **skilled burglar and locksmith** who sometimes works with Tess.
  - More cautious and careful, **always cleaning up Tess’s messes**.
  - They have a **rivalry over who can pull off the best job**, but Cass is always there when things go bad.

- **Silas Grey (Fence & Information Broker)**

  - A **human fence who deals in stolen goods** and secrets.
  - Works out of the **River Quarter**, making sure the right hands get the right “merchandise.”
  - Silas and Tess **owe each other favors**, and he often **warns her about Thieves’ Guild activity**.

- **Delphi (Mysterious Benefactor?)**
  - An **elusive noblewoman** who has occasionally **funded Tess’s exploits in exchange for… something**.
  - Tess doesn’t **fully trust** her but **knows she’s powerful**.
  - Is Delphi just **using her** for her own agenda? Or does she **genuinely see potential in Tess?**

### **Rivals, Foes & People Hunting Her**

- **The Greyhawk Thieves’ Guild (Enemy, Constant Threat)**

  - Tess **burned bridges** with the Guild when she **refused to work under their control**.
  - Some guild members want her **dead, captured, or to pay her debt**.
  - Others might respect her skill and **try to recruit her again**.

- **Vance Dusk (Thieves’ Guild Enforcer, Rival)**

  - A **cold, calculating rogue** sent to bring Tess in—**or put her down**.
  - He **doesn’t hate her personally** but sees her as **a loose end to tie up**.
  - They **used to work together** before she left the Guild.
  - **Tension:** Did they have a **past relationship**? Was there **betrayal** involved?

- **Baron Othric Devrin (Corrupt Noble, Sworn Enemy)**

  - One of **Greyhawk’s most ruthless nobles**, **known for exploiting the poor**.

  - Now he **wants revenge**, and he has **resources to make her life miserable**.

  - Tess **doesn’t know if they’re real or just rumors**, but she **needs answers.**
  - If they do exist, she might be **next on their list**.

### **Current Goals & Motivations**

1. Outrun the Thieves’ Guild: Tess needs to stay one step ahead of the guild enforcers who still want to collect a debt (or her head).
2. Expose Corruption: She thrives on toppling the powerful through elaborate schemes, often aiding the downtrodden in the process.
3. Find the Ultimate Score: A legendary con, a heist of a lifetime, or perhaps a grand scheme to outwit the city’s most untouchable elites.

### **Long-Term Aspirations**

1. **The Ultimate Score** – A **heist so legendary** it will put her name in history.

   - Maybe it’s **Greyhawk’s royal treasury**, a **hidden vault**, or a **priceless artifact.**
   - Whatever it is, she wants **one last, perfect con** before retiring.

2. **Revenge & Redemption** – She wants to **bring down** the **nobles and guilds** that abuse power.

   - Maybe she **uncovers a scandal** so big it **shakes Greyhawk’s elite**.
   - She also wants to **find her brother, Toby, and her parents' fate**.

3. **Freedom & Identity** – Tess hates being **controlled** or **tied down**.

   - She might **create her own rogue network**, one that actually helps the downtrodden.
   - Or she **fakes her own death** and starts over somewhere new.

4. **A Worthy Rival** – Every great con artist **needs an opponent** who **keeps them on their toes**.
   - Maybe it’s a **detective** determined to catch her.
   - Maybe it’s a **master thief** who always outsmarts her.
   - She wants **someone who can challenge her** in the grand game of deception.
