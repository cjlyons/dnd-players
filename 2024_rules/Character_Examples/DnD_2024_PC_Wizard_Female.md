## Back Story

### Background & Early Life

Born in the heart of Greyhawk, Lucia Draevan grew up surrounded by the clang of metal, the shimmer of enchantments, and the heady scent of alchemical reagents. Her family ran Draevan Arcane Works, a renowned artisan workshop catering to nobility, merchants, and ambitious wizards. While her brothers took to the family trade in a more traditional manner—crafting fine jewelry and imbuing mundane objects with minor magical enhancements—Lucia was different.  
From the moment she could hold a chisel, she wanted to take things apart as much as she wanted to create. Clocks, wands, enchanted amulets—if it had a mechanism, a sigil, or a spark of magic, she wanted to know how it worked. This curiosity often led to _accidents_—a disassembled teleportation ring that flung their cat into another plane, a failed alchemical experiment that melted half the shop’s floorboards.  
Recognizing both her talent and her recklessness, her family arranged an apprenticeship with Master Orlan Vithan, an artificer of great renown. Vithan was a rigid scholar who saw magic as a precise science, not a playground for reckless experiments. Lucia chafed under these restrictions. She questioned everything, challenged tradition, and experimented wildly. Eventually, she crossed a line—crafting a spell-forged blade infused with unstable energy that nearly detonated in Vithan’s workshop.  
Rather than accept expulsion with shame, Lucia walked away with pride. She would prove to the world that true magical mastery came not from rigid discipline, but from fearless innovation.

### Current Goals & Motivations

1. Mastery Over Magic as a Craft, Not Just a Discipline: Lucia sees magic not as an esoteric force to be worshiped or feared, but as a craft to be refined. Just as a blacksmith tempers steel or a weaver perfects their technique, she believes magic should be honed, reshaped, and innovated. She rejects the rigid traditions of arcane study that demand rote memorization and adherence to outdated methods. Instead, she strives to reinvent magic, blending disciplines and breaking limitations to turn spellcraft into a true art form—one unrestricted by the dogma of wizards, priests, or scholars.
2. Defiance of Authority and Gatekeepers of Knowledge: Lucia despises institutions that hoard knowledge under the guise of "protecting" it. Whether it's secretive wizard guilds, religious orders that suppress certain magics, or ancient organizations that dictate what magic can and cannot be used, she sees them all as barriers to progress. She is determined to uncover and reclaim forbidden or forgotten knowledge, believing that no one has the right to decide what others should or shouldn't learn. This sometimes places her at odds with powerful groups who see her relentless curiosity as dangerous.
3. Leaving Behind a Legacy that Matters: More than power, wealth, or recognition, Lucia wants to be remembered. She doesn’t just seek to master magic for his own sake—she wants to change the course of magical history. Whether that means creating a new form of spellcraft, revolutionizing magical item creation, or unlocking secrets that reshape the world, she refuses to be just another name lost to time. She will leave something behind that outlives her, even if it means challenging the natural order to do so.  
   Personality & Conflicts
4. Curiosity First, Morality Second: Lucia’s desire to push the boundaries of magical knowledge is both her greatest strength and her greatest flaw. She does not seek power for power’s sake, but she is willing to take risks that others wouldn’t dare. She has little patience for those who preach caution without offering solutions.
5. Socially Selective: While she is not a recluse, Lucia is picky about her company. She enjoys debating scholars, trading knowledge with fellow artificers, and occasionally sharing a drink with adventurers who have tales of lost ruins and arcane secrets. But she has no patience for dogma, bureaucracy, or those who fear progress.
6. Chaotic Innovator: The world sees rules; Lucia sees suggestions. She is an artist with magic, a scientist with enchantment, a philosopher with the arcane. She bends traditions until they break and then rebuilds them into something new. Whether this makes her a visionary or a lunatic is yet to be seen.

### The Shadow of Nythra

Lucia’s celestial owl, Nythra, is both a companion and a constant reminder of the ethical dilemmas her work presents. She does not dictate Lucia’s actions, but she nudges—a knowing glance, a soft hoot when she considers an experiment that veers toward the dangerous or inhumane. Sometimes, Lucia listens. Sometimes, she brushes her off. But deep down, she knows that if she ever truly disapproved, Nythra might leave her—and that thought unsettles her more than she cares to admit.

Lucia Draevan is a woman standing at the precipice of magical discovery, teetering between brilliance and catastrophe. Will she be remembered as a revolutionary genius or as a cautionary tale? The world has yet to decide.
