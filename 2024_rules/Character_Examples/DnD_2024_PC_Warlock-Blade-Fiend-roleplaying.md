## **TL;DR – Bringing Zerathis to Life**

- **Confident, noble presence** – speaks smoothly, commands respect.
- **Witty & calculating** – enjoys verbal sparring, strategy, and high-stakes games.
- **Hides his past** – avoids his true name, dodges questions about Rauxes.
- **Struggles with temptation** – feels the pull of infernal power but resists it (for now).
- **A warrior first, a warlock second** – fights with skill, not just raw magic.
- **Loyal to a few trusted allies** – despite his ruthless exterior, he values those he truly respects.

## **1. Noble Bearing, Even in Exile**

Zer **was raised in privilege**—even though he’s a mercenary now, his **demeanor should still reflect nobility**:

- **Speaks with confidence**—rarely stammers or hesitates, even when lying.
- **Commands respect**—he expects to be listened to, even by those who don’t know his name.
- **Maintains etiquette**—he’ll **address people formally** unless he’s mocking them.
- **Rarely grovels**—even when outmatched, he tries to **bargain, negotiate, or intimidate** rather than beg.

- _Example RP:_  
  _Zerathis smirks as the orcish thug steps forward._  
  _"I’ll give you one chance, brute. Stand down and walk away with your teeth… or kneel and offer me your blade. You have three seconds."_

---

## **2. The Charismatic Duelist**

As a trained **fighter and manipulator**, Zer should **enjoy the thrill of high-stakes situations**—whether in **combat, gambling, or social intrigue**.

- **Gambles frequently**—3-Dragon Ante should be a staple of his downtime.
- **Enjoys testing people**—might challenge a proud warrior to a friendly spar or provoke an arrogant noble with wordplay.
- **Uses wit in combat**—he might taunt an opponent mid-fight or offer them a chance to surrender.

- _Example RP (Gambling):_  
  _"Fortune is a fickle thing, friend. But skill? That I trust. Care to test your luck? Let’s raise the stakes—your coin… for a secret."_

- _Example RP (Combat):_  
  _"You're swinging that blade like a farmer with a scythe. Shall I show you how a noble fights?"_

## **3. The Infernal Shadow – A Devil’s Whispers**

Zer **hears the voice of Xeltharion, his infernal patron**. He doesn’t always acknowledge it, but it’s **always there**, lurking at the edge of his mind.

- **Occasionally pauses, as if listening to something others don’t hear.**
- **Echoes some of the patron’s phrases**—it’s slowly influencing his speech.
- **Struggles with temptation**—does he take the easy path of power or fight against it?

- _Example RP:_  
  _(After winning a battle, standing over a defeated enemy.)_  
  _Xeltharion’s voice echoes in his mind: “Take their soul. Claim their strength.”_  
  _Zer flexes his fingers, his eyes flickering with hellfire—then exhales sharply._  
  _"Not yet."_

---

## **4. Hiding His Past – A Name Too Dangerous to Speak**

Zerathis Kaelmont is **not a name he gives freely**.

- **Uses a false name when meeting new people**—“Zer,” “Zane,” or “Kael.”
- **Avoids talking about Rauxes unless absolutely necessary.**
- **May react coldly to anyone who pries into his past.**

- _Example RP:_  
  _When asked about his past:_  
  _"Oh, my childhood? Farms, fields, good honest work. Absolutely nothing scandalous, no, of course not."_ _(quickly changes the subject)._

---

## **5. The Redemption vs. Damnation Struggle**

His story arc is about **choosing between embracing his infernal power or resisting it**.

- **At first, he will refuse to use magic.**
- **The first time he casts an eldritch blast, he should react—shocked, conflicted, or tempted.**
- **Slowly starts referring to the patron more often, willingly or unwillingly.**
- **His voice and demeanor may subtly shift over time, becoming colder or more intense as the fiend’s influence grows.**

- _Example RP (First Time Using Magic):_  
  _(A sudden blast of crimson energy erupts from his palm, incinerating his enemy.)_  
  _Zer looks down at his own hand, flexing his fingers, eyes wide._  
  _"…No. No, not yet."_ _(He shakes it off, but the fire still lingers in his palm before fading.)_
