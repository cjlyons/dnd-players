### **Early Life in the Lortmil Mountains**

Born into the **Stonebinder Clan**, Durgen was raised in **Farner**, a **mountain stronghold** nestled in the Lortmil Mountains. Unlike many dwarves who prided themselves on mining and smithing, his family was part of the **agricultural caste**, responsible for **food production**—a **vital yet often overlooked** role in the clan.

The **Stonebinders** were among the **oldest and most respected** farming families in the clan, tending both **underground and surface farms** to provide food for their kin. **Below the surface**, they cultivated **fungal crops**, bred **giant goats and cave boars**, and maintained **hydroponic-style irrigation systems**. **Above ground**, they raised **mountain ponies**, tended hardy fields of **barley and root vegetables**, and protected livestock from **predators and raiders**.

Though some **traditionalist dwarves** saw farming as lesser compared to smithing and war, Durgen never felt ashamed. He knew that without families like his, the clan would starve.

### **His Family & Upbringing**

Durgen was raised with the values of **hard work, honor, and self-sufficiency**. His parents instilled in him the belief that **a dwarf’s duty is to provide for his people, no matter the task.**

- **Father – Dorin Stonebinder** (Master Carpenter & Farmer)  
  A quiet but wise dwarf who valued craftsmanship and patience. He taught Durgen how to **repair and build farm structures, tools, and wagons**, ensuring that nothing went to waste. His carpentry skills became an essential part of his son’s training.
- **Mother – Bryndra Stonebinder** (Livestock Keeper & Herbalist)  
  She managed the **mountain ponies, goats, and cave boars**, teaching Durgen how to **handle animals, recognize illnesses, and navigate mountain trails safely**.
- **Older Brother – Tharik Stonebinder** (Clan Traditionalist, Heir to the Farm)  
  Unlike Durgen, Tharik embraced the **conservative mindset** of the clan. He believed that the **underground should be their sole focus** and often clashed with his younger brother about the **value of surface farming**.
- **Younger Sister – Kelda Stonebinder** (Runesmith’s Apprentice)  
  A **bright and ambitious** dwarf who turned to **runecrafting and metallurgy**, looking beyond farming for her future. She and Durgen were close, and she often crafted **small charms and inscriptions** to aid his work in the fields.

### **Mentors & Teachers**

- **Garrim Flintbreaker** (Old Warrior & Mentor)  
  A retired warrior who had once served in the **Greyhawk Wars**, Garrim lived near the **surface farms**, preferring solitude over the crowded halls of the stronghold. He saw potential in Durgen and, in exchange for **labor on his homestead**, he trained him in **combat techniques, battlefield strategy, and endurance**. Garrim taught him how to **fight not as a brawler, but as a disciplined warrior**.
- **Captain Halgrim Ironfist** (Clan Defender & Rival)  
  The leader of the **Stonebinder Guard**, Halgrim saw **little value in farmers wielding weapons**. Though he respected Garrim, he believed that **true warriors should be forged in the mountain halls, not in fields and pastures**. He never outright dismissed Durgen, but his **doubt and condescension** pushed him to **prove himself**.

### **The Raid That Changed Everything**

The **orcs came at dawn**, under the cover of a thick mountain fog. **It was not just a raid—it was an invasion.**

A horde of **orc warbands**, led by the ruthless **Urzog One-Eye**, descended from the northern passes, seeking to **pillage, burn, and slaughter**. The **surface farms were the first to fall**, their **livestock stolen, barns torched, and warriors cut down**. Durgen fought **fiercely**, rallying the defenders, wielding his axe against the invaders. He slew **many**, but the battle was **too great**.

When Urzog himself arrived, the **Stonebinders were forced to retreat into the mountain**, sealing the **main gates** behind them. **But not before Durgen saw his home, the farm he had worked so hard to protect, consumed by fire.**

The **clan survived**, but at great cost. The **surface farms were lost**, and many dwarves **blamed Durgen**, believing the farmers had been too exposed, their defenses too weak. **The clan council decreed that rebuilding the farms was no longer a priority**, choosing to focus on fortifying the mountain instead.

### **Exile & Arrival in Greyhawk**

For Durgen, this was an unbearable **betrayal**. He had fought, bled, and nearly died to defend **his people’s way of life**, and now **the council abandoned it**. **The land was still salvageable, the farms could be rebuilt—but they refused.**

He spoke against the decision, but the **council dismissed him**, calling him **"a warrior with a farmer's heart"**—as if that was an insult. Furious, disillusioned, and grieving, he **chose exile**.

With **his axe, armor, and the skills he had honed** in the mountains, he left Farner, traveling east toward **the City of Greyhawk**, seeking **a new path**.

### **Life in Greyhawk**

Now in Greyhawk, he **lives among mercenaries and artisans**, his strength earning him work as a **city guard, caravan protector, and hired blade**. Yet, **he still carries the values of his homeland**—discipline, resilience, and the belief that **hard work is the foundation of all things.**

Though he **does not regret his decision**, he knows his story **isn’t over**.

### **Key People in His Life**

- **Still Alive & Important:** **Garrim Flintbreaker** – His old mentor, still living in the mountains. He occasionally sends messages to Greyhawk, offering wisdom and encouragement.
- **Current Friend/Rival:** **Durn Blackbrow** – A fellow dwarf living in Greyhawk, working as a **trader and supplier of rare metals**. They sometimes work together, but their differing perspectives on dwarven tradition lead to frequent **arguments and camaraderie alike**.
- **Admired but Unmet:** **King Thrain Deepaxe** – A **legendary dwarven warlord and tactician** he idolizes, rumored to be reforging old alliances against a looming threat.

### **Goals & Motivations**

- **Restore His Honor** – Prove to his clan that **farmers are warriors too**, and that he was right to stand by their traditions.
- **Avenge the Raid** – Track down **Urzog One-Eye** and **reclaim what was stolen** from his people.
- **Find a New Purpose** – Whether **forging his own stronghold, building a mercenary company, or reclaiming lost dwarven relics**, he refuses to be **just a wandering sword.**

### **Long-Term Aspirations**

- **Reclaim the Lost Farms** – If he can **one day return to the Lortmils**, he dreams of **restoring the surface farms**, proving that **his family’s work was not in vain**.
- **Build Something that Lasts** – Whether it’s **a new home, a brotherhood, or a legacy**, he wants **his name to mean something**.
- **Uncover Lost Dwarven History** – The **depths of Greyhawk and beyond** hold secrets of **dwarven ancestors**, and he believes **knowledge of the past can strengthen the future.**

### **Personality & Character Traits**

#### **1. Hard as the Mountain, Soft as the Soil**

- **Gruff and practical** in most situations, especially in battle or negotiations. He speaks plainly and expects the same from others.
- However, he has **a deep respect for nature and life**, treating animals and growing things with surprising gentleness.

#### **2. Work First, Talk Later**

- He **expresses care through action rather than words**—he’ll sharpen your sword, help repair a damaged bridge, or haul gear without being asked, but he won’t say “you’re welcome.”
- Prefers **efficiency over pleasantries**, often answering with a grunt, nod, or single-word reply unless pushed for more.

#### **3. Battle-Tested, Not Bloodthirsty**

- Views **violence as a necessary tool**, not a source of enjoyment. He fights **to protect, not to conquer**.
- If a battle can be avoided, he prefers to **end things quickly and efficiently** rather than drag out a fight.

#### **4. Farming Instincts Never Die**

- Keeps **track of the weather instinctively**, often commenting on changes in air pressure, wind direction, or the smell of rain.
- Tends to **wake up before sunrise**, even in the city. He gets irritated when others sleep too long.
- Still **sizes up land and soil quality** whenever he travels, muttering things like, _“Hmph. Too much clay. Won’t hold roots well.”_

---

### **Quirks & Habits**

#### **5. A Warrior’s Beard, A Farmer’s Hands**

- Runs his fingers through his beard when thinking, sometimes absentmindedly **braiding or unbraiding small sections**.
- **Always keeps his hands busy**—if he isn’t sharpening his axe, he’s whittling wood, carving symbols into his armor, or fixing broken tools.

#### **6. He Never Wastes Good Food**

- Has **no patience for picky eaters** or people who waste food—he will finish whatever’s on his plate, even if it’s terrible.
- Will grumble _“food’s food”_ if someone complains about a meal.

#### **7. Hates Deep, Cramped Tunnels**

- Unlike many dwarves, he **prefers open spaces**, a result of spending much of his life **on surface farms** rather than deep mines.
- In **cramped tunnels** or **deep dungeons**, he gets noticeably more irritable and restless, **constantly checking exit routes**.

#### **8. Dwarven Superstitions**

- Believes **growing a beard long keeps your ancestors’ spirits close**—he will never shave it completely.
- **Throws a pinch of dirt over his shoulder** before battle, an old farming superstition to **"give the earth something first, so it doesn’t take too much back."**
- Won’t **drink water from an uncovered barrel**, fearing **"it lets in bad spirits."**

---

### **Emotional Depth & Motivations**

#### **9. He Carries His Home With Him**

- He **still wears his family’s farming sigil** on his belt buckle, even though his clan **turned their backs on the surface lands.**
- He **keeps a small pouch of soil from his farm**, taken before he left. Sometimes, when alone, he runs it through his fingers, **whispering to his ancestors.**

#### **10. He’s Searching for a New Legacy**

- Despite his tough exterior, **he fears becoming forgotten**—he doesn’t want his life to be meaningless, to fade like dust in the wind.
- He **wants to build something lasting**—whether it’s **a mercenary brotherhood, a new settlement, or a legacy of his own making.**
