Tess Thornhill grew up in **Clerkburg**, one of the more refined districts in **Greyhawk City**, but her life was far from academic. While Clerkburg is home to **scholars, scribes, and bureaucrats**, Tess’s upbringing was shaped by the **grit of the streets** rather than the halls of learning.

## **Clerkburg – The Scholarly District with a Corrupt Core**

- **Description:** The district is filled with **scribe houses, record keepers, universities, and bureaucratic offices**, making it the heart of Greyhawk’s **paper-pushing elite**.

- **Notable Features:**
  - **Grey College** – The city's premier university, full of **wealthy but gullible students** and **professors who rarely noticed missing coin purses**.
  - **Guildhalls & Government Offices** – Endless bureaucracy made it easy to forge **permits, deeds, and false contracts**.
  - **The Scriptorium** – A massive library and book-copying service, where Tess **swiped official-looking seals and parchment** for her cons.
  - **The Moneylenders' Row** – A stretch of streets where merchants, banks, and **shady loan sharks** operate. Tess **picked pockets, ran cons, and dodged debt collectors** here.

### **How It Shaped Tess**

- **Confidence Schemes:** Tess learned how to **fake noble credentials, forge letters of recommendation**, and **sell false deeds** to gullible bureaucrats.
- **Silver-Tongued Hustling:** Being surrounded by **wealthy scholars and aristocrats**, she **learned how to speak their language** and pass as a well-bred rogue.
- **A Disdain for Authority:** Seeing the **corruption and inefficiency** of Greyhawk’s elite made Tess realize that **laws exist to protect the powerful, not the people**.

  - **The Mud Lanes** – A maze of **narrow alleys and rickety houses** where Tess **hides when heat is on her**.

  - **Silas Grey’s Pawnshop** – A **fence and information broker** who helps Tess offload stolen goods **for a cut**.
  - **The Black Flagon Tavern** – A **bar where rogue freelancers** (like Tess) gather—**neutral ground**, away from Thieves' Guild control.

### **How It Shapes Tess Now**

- **Freelance Roguery:** Tess works **outside the Guild**, picking up jobs that target **corrupt merchants, nobles, and crooked city officials**.
