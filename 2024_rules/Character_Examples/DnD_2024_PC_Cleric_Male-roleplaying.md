# **Roleplaying Tips**

**Bringing him to life**

1. **Speak with controlled authority** – His words **carry weight**.
2. **Use silence as power** – His presence alone should be **commanding**.
3. **Show discipline in body language** – He is **never reckless**.
4. **Make loyalty meaningful** – When he calls someone _friend_, it **means something**.
5. **Struggle with moral dilemmas** – He follows law, but **only when it serves justice**.

By **staying consistent with his discipline, duty, and silent strength**, Aric will feel **memorable, impactful, and real**.

## **1. Speech & Mannerisms**

Aric **speaks with purpose**—never wasting words. His speech is **measured, firm, and authoritative** without being boastful.

- **Use deliberate and concise phrases**:

  - _"Justice is not found in words, but in action."_
  - _"A promise is as strong as the will that keeps it."_
  - _"Steel does not waver. Neither shall I."_

- **Avoid excessive small talk** – He is not unfriendly, but he does not engage in idle chatter unless necessary.
- **Use a deep, steady tone** – When he speaks, **others listen**.
- **Pause before answering** – He thinks before he speaks, ensuring his words carry weight.

- **What NOT to do:**

  - Don’t rush to fill silence. Let his presence speak for itself.
  - Don’t joke too much—he’s not humorless, but he doesn’t engage in banter often.

## **2. Body Language & Presence**

Aric **commands attention without trying**. His presence is **one of quiet authority**, like an anvil that endures countless strikes yet remains unbroken.

- **Stand tall, move with discipline** – Every step and motion should feel purposeful.
- **Minimal but deliberate gestures** – When he points, nods, or raises a hand, it means something.
- **Shows respect through action, not words** –

  - Instead of saying _"I respect you,"_ he might **clasp a comrade’s forearm firmly**.
  - Instead of saying _"I will protect you,"_ he might **step in front of them without a word**.

- **What NOT to do:**

  - Avoid fidgeting, pacing, or unnecessary movement. **He is a fortress, not a breeze.**
  - Avoid nervous habits—he does not second-guess himself in public.

## **3. How He Handles Conflict**

Aric is **not easily provoked**. He does not react with anger but **with cold, measured control**.

- **Calm, but firm confrontation** – When dealing with criminals, corrupt officials, or those who test his patience:

  - _"Do not mistake my patience for weakness."_
  - _"You know what you are doing is wrong. You have a chance to step back. Take it."_

- **A presence that de-escalates situations** –

  - If a fight is unnecessary, he may try to **stare someone down until they reconsider**.
  - If an ally is being reckless, he may **place a steady hand on their shoulder** and say: _"Think."_

- **What NOT to do:**

  - He does not lose control—**even in anger, he remains measured**.
  - He does not **mock or threaten**, only **warns and enforces**.

## **4. Religious Devotion & Rituals**

Aric’s faith in **Herioreous** is not **loud or fanatical**—it is **deep, steady, and woven into his every action**.

- **Incorporate Small Rituals** –
- **Before battle**: He **touches the hammer pendant around his neck**, offering a silent prayer.
- **After victory**: He **kneels for a brief moment**, honoring those who fell.
- **When forging a weapon**: He **taps the metal three times**, an old ritual to ensure its strength.

- **View faith as duty, not dogma** – He does not demand others worship Herioreous, but he **expects them to act with honor**.

- **What NOT to do:**

  - Avoid preaching—he is a **warrior-cleric, not a missionary**.
  - Do not assume all laws are just—he serves **justice, not blind authority**.

## **5. Relationships & Team Dynamics**

Aric values **loyalty, discipline, and honor**. He does not trust easily, but once someone earns his respect, he **will stand by them until the end**.

- **Signs of Trust & Respect:**
- **The Warrior’s Grip** – He clasps forearms with those he respects, instead of shaking hands.
- **Silent Approval** – If he respects an ally’s decision, he will **nod once, slow and deliberate**.
- **Sharing the Burden** – If an ally is struggling, he wordlessly **helps carry their gear or watches their back**.
- **Battle Oath** – Before a major fight, he might exchange a simple vow with his allies:

  - _"We stand together. We fall together. But we do not break."_

- **Subtle Warmth** – Though stoic, he has moments of kindness:

  - Standing **outside a wounded ally’s tent all night** to guard them.
  - Smithing **a personalized weapon** for a comrade who has proven their worth.
  - Saying _"You fought well today"_—which, from him, **means a lot**.

- **What NOT to do:**

  - He does not **give compliments lightly**—when he praises someone, it carries meaning.
  - He does not **laugh often**, but when he does, it is **rare and genuine**.

## **6. Moral Dilemmas & Tough Choices**

Aric’s **greatest internal struggle** is balancing **law and justice**. He wants to **do the right thing**, but **sometimes the law is corrupt, and justice is not clear-cut**.

- **How to Roleplay Tough Choices:**

  - If a **corrupt official** orders something unjust, he will pause, **weigh his duty against his morals**, and say:
    - _"The law must serve justice, not itself."_
  - If a **criminal pleads for mercy**, he will consider:
    - _"Redemption is possible, but so is consequence."_
  - If an ally **pushes for vengeance**, he may warn:

    - _"Justice is not the same as wrath."_

- **When to Show Inner Conflict:**
  - If he ever **questions Herioreous’ will**, he will **go to the forge** to reflect, crafting something as a form of meditation.
  - If forced to do something he regrets, he may **leave a personal mark on his armor**—a silent reminder.
  - If betrayed, he will **not lash out**—but he **will not forget**.

## **7. Combat Roleplaying**

Aric fights **like an anvil**—unshakable, relentless, and focused.

- **Signature Combat Gestures:**

  - Before battle, he **slams his shield against the ground**—a declaration that he **will not fall**.
  - Against a sworn enemy, he **locks eyes with them and silently draws a line across his chest**—marking them for judgment.
  - When an ally is in danger, he **steps between them and the threat without hesitation**.

- **Battle Cries & Phrases:**
  - _"Stand firm! Justice does not falter!"_
  - _"You cannot break the unbreakable."_
  - _"I do not break. I do not bend. I do not fall."_
