## Back Story

### Early Life & Divine Calling

Born in the Artisan’s Quarter of Greyhawk, Aria Valdran was raised in a humble but disciplined household. Her father was a master armorer, known for crafting durable plate mail for the city guard and noble houses, while her mother was a devoted scholar of Helm’s doctrine. From an early age, Aria was instilled with the values of duty, vigilance, and the sanctity of order.  
Unlike many other aasimar, whose celestial heritage manifests in grand visions or divine revelations, Aria’s connection to the divine was quiet and steady, like a smith’s hammer striking metal. She never heard the voice of Helm directly, but she felt his presence in the clang of steel, the discipline of the forge, and the unwavering duty of those who stood watch over others.

### Turning Point

As Aria grew, so too did her skill as a weaponsmith. Under her father’s guidance, she learned how to forge unbreakable blades, sturdy shields, and mastercrafted armor—but her life took a different path when a paladin of Helm came to their shop, seeking a weapon to combat a growing criminal syndicate in the city.  
That night, assassins came for the paladin. Aria, waking to the sounds of battle, took up a hammer and fought alongside the holy warrior, holding the line until reinforcements arrived. When the dust settled, the paladin looked upon Aria and said, "You are not just meant to forge weapons—you are meant to wield them in Helm’s name."  
Taking this as a sign, Aria left behind the forge and took up the mantle of a cleric of Helm, swearing to dedicate her life to upholding law, protecting the innocent, and ensuring vigilance never falters.

### Current Role & Motivations

Now a full-fledged cleric of Helm, Aria serves as a guardian and enforcer of order in Greyhawk. She operates from a modest chapel in the Garden Quarter, offering blessings to city guards, repairing arms and armor for the faithful, and ensuring that the laws of Helm are upheld. However, her path is not without conflict:

1. A Lawful But Neutral Stance – While Aria believes in law and duty, she recognizes that Greyhawk is full of corruption. She walks a fine line between enforcing order and questioning authority, ensuring that she does not become a pawn for the city’s more corrupt officials.
2. A Conflict with the Thieves’ Guild – Aria has openly opposed the Thieves’ Guild, refusing to provide them with weapons or protection. This has made her a target, with certain factions wanting her either silenced or bribed.
3. The Forgotten Duty – While she upholds law in Greyhawk, Aria’s celestial blood whispers that her duty extends beyond the city walls. There are greater evils and larger conflicts—perhaps Helm has greater plans for her than she realizes.

### Personality & Traits

1. Disciplined & Stoic – Like a forge-hardened blade, Aria values self-control, patience, and discipline.
2. Unyielding in Duty – If she swears an oath, she will fulfill it, no matter the cost.
3. A Master of the Forge – Even as a cleric, Aria never abandoned her craftsmanship. She continues to forge weapons and armor, seeing them as sacred tools in the defense of order.
