## Back Story

### Born to Battle

Garra Stonefury was born in the harsh, snow-laden peaks of the Crystalmist Mountains, where only the strong survived. Hers tribe, the Skybreakers, valued strength, endurance, and honor above all else. From childhood, Garra was raised on the philosophy of strength through competition—a belief that only by constantly testing oneself against others could a warrior truly grow.
By the time he was of age, Garra had already earned a name for herself among hers people, winning countless contests of wrestling, stone-lifting, foot races across treacherous cliffs, and brutal sparring matches. But hers hunger for challenge went beyond sport. She trained as a warrior of the Skybreakers, standing as a guardian against those who dared to threaten hers people—whether it be the roving bands of orcs, the raiders from the lowlands, or the harshness of the wild itself.

### A Spirit That Couldn’t Be Contained

Yet, no matter how many battles she fought or challenges she conquered, Garra felt a growing restlessness. His tribe was small, and their battles were the same battles fought for generations. She had bested every rival, lifted every boulder, and outrun every challenger. She longed for more—for greater foes, grander trials, and a place where his strength could be truly tested.  
One night, beneath the full moon, she stood atop the highest peak near Gorna, looking out beyond the mountains. The wind whispered to her of the great city of Greyhawk, a place where warriors from every land clashed, where adventurers sought glory, and where battle was never far away. His fate lay beyond the mountains.

### Arrival in Greyhawk

The transition from tribal warrior to city dweller was no easy feat. Garra found the laws and customs of the city strange, the people small and fragile, and the fights... far less honorable than those among his tribe. But she adapted, learning the ways of mercenaries, gladiators, and sellswords.

1. She joined underground fighting pits, earning coin and fame with his sheer strength and unbreakable will.
2. She took on mercenary work, guarding caravans and noble houses—though she quickly grew frustrated with “standing around” rather than fighting.
3. She found a band of adventurers, warriors who sought danger, treasure, and battle, and knew that this was where she belonged.

### Personality & Beliefs

1. Loyal & Pragmatic – Though she has embraced the chaos of adventure, Garra still follows the Goliath code of honor: trust must be earned, oaths must be kept, and strength is to be respected.
2. Competitive & Boastful – Whether it’s arm-wrestling in a tavern or slaying a monstrous foe, Garra never misses a chance to prove herself. She keeps a running list of his greatest victories and will eagerly tell anyone who listens.
3. Thrives on Challenge – She doesn’t seek bloodshed for bloodshed’s sake, but she believes that only through struggle can one become truly strong.
