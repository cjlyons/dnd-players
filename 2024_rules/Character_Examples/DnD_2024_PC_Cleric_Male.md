## **Back Story**

[roleplaing tips](./DnD_2024_PC_Cleric_Male-roleplaying.md)

### **Early Life & Divine Calling**

Born in the Artisan’s Quarter of Greyhawk, Aric Valdran was raised in a humble but disciplined household. His father was a master armorer, known for crafting durable plate mail for the city guard and noble houses, while his mother was a devoted scholar of Herioreous' doctrine. From an early age, Aric was instilled with the values of duty, vigilance, and the sanctity of order.  
Unlike many other aasimar, whose celestial heritage manifests in grand visions or divine revelations, Aric’s connection to the divine was quiet and steady, like a smith’s hammer striking metal. He never heard the voice of Herioreous directly, but he felt his presence in the clang of steel, the discipline of the forge, and the unwavering duty of those who stood watch over others.

---

### **Turning Point**

As Aric grew, so too did his skill as a weaponsmith. Under his father’s guidance, he learned how to forge unbreakable blades, sturdy shields, and mastercrafted armor—but his life took a different path when a paladin of Herioreous came to their shop, seeking a weapon to combat a growing criminal syndicate in the city.  
That night, assassins came for the paladin. Aric, waking to the sounds of battle, took up a hammer and fought alongside the holy warrior, holding the line until reinforcements arrived. When the dust settled, the paladin looked upon Aric and said, "You are not just meant to forge weapons—you are meant to wield them in Herioreous' name."  
Taking this as a sign, Aric left behind the forge and took up the mantle of a cleric of Herioreous, swearing to dedicate his life to upholding law, protecting the innocent, and ensuring vigilance never falters.

---

### **Current Role & Motivations**

Now a full-fledged cleric of Herioreous, Aric serves as a guardian and enforcer of order in Greyhawk. He operates from a modest chapel in the Garden Quarter, offering blessings to city guards, repairing arms and armor for the faithful, and ensuring that the laws of Herioreous are upheld. However, his path is not without conflict:

1. A Lawful But Neutral Stance – While Aric believes in law and duty, he recognizes that Greyhawk is full of corruption. He walks a fine line between enforcing order and questioning authority, ensuring that he does not become a pawn for the city’s more corrupt officials.
2. A Conflict with the Thieves’ Guild – Aric has openly opposed the Thieves’ Guild, refusing to provide them with weapons or protection. This has made him a target, with certain factions wanting him either silenced or bribed.
3. The Forgotten Duty – While he upholds law in Greyhawk, Aric’s celestial blood whispers that his duty extends beyond the city walls. There are greater evils and larger conflicts—perhaps Herioreous has greater plans for him than he realizes.

### **Personality & Traits**

Sir Aric Valdran is the embodiment of **discipline, duty, and vigilance**. He speaks with measured words, never acting rashly or without purpose. He does not seek personal glory but instead upholds the ideals of **law, honor, and protection**. While he respects hierarchy and structure, he is **not blind to corruption**, and his loyalty lies with the ideals of **justice over mere obedience**.

1. Disciplined & Stoic – Like a forge-hardened blade, Aric values self-control, patience, and discipline.
2. Unyielding in Duty – If he swears an oath, he will fulfill it, no matter the cost.
3. A Master of the Forge – Even as a cleric, Aric never abandoned his craftsmanship. He continues to forge weapons and armor, seeing them as sacred tools in the defense of order.

### **Beliefs:**

- **The Law Must Serve Justice** – He supports order, but **law for law’s sake is meaningless if it does not protect the innocent**. He will not blindly follow unjust laws.
- **Heritage is a Duty, Not a Privilege** – His celestial blood is not a mark of superiority, but a **burden and obligation to serve something greater**.
- **Steel & Faith Are One** – A well-crafted blade and an unwavering will **are both weapons in the battle against chaos and darkness**.
- **Corruption Must Be Rooted Out** – He is no crusading zealot, but he does not turn a blind eye to corruption. He **believes in purging injustice from within the system**, though he must tread carefully.
- **Every Weapon Has a Purpose** – He does not forge weapons for profit. **Every sword, hammer, and shield he creates must serve a just cause.**

### **Quirks & Flaws**

**Quirks:**

- **Touches the Hammer Pendant on His Neck Before Battle** – A silent prayer to Herioreous, reaffirming his purpose.
- **Taps Metal Three Times Before Crafting** – A habit from his smithing days, believed to bring precision and focus to his work.
- **Rarely Drinks Alcohol** – Not out of strict abstinence, but because he values self-control. If he does drink, it is always in moderation.
- **Doesn’t Wear Ornate Armor** – Prefers practical, unadorned plate or chainmail. Believes **extravagance in battle is arrogance.**
- **Has a Deep, Resonant Voice** – When he speaks, it **commands attention**, even when quiet.

**Flaws & Struggles:**

- **Rigid in His Code** – His **unyielding sense of duty can make him inflexible**, especially in morally gray situations. He struggles to bend, even when pragmatism is needed.
- **Cannot Ignore an Oath** – If he gives his word, **he will fulfill it, even if it leads to his suffering**. This can be exploited by clever manipulators.
- **Struggles with Mercy vs. Justice** – He **wants to believe in redemption**, but he also knows some foes are beyond saving. The balance between **justice and vengeance** is something he grapples with.
- **Alienated by His Aasimar Heritage** – Despite his human upbringing, he sometimes feels **detached from those around him**, as if Herioreous expects more from him than from others.
- **Has a Long Memory** – Aric is **slow to forgive those who betray trust**. He does not act in anger, but he **does not forget treachery**.
