## **Back Story**

### **Early Life & Divine Calling**

Born in the Artisan’s Quarter of Greyhawk, Aric Valdran was raised in a humble but disciplined household. His father was a master armorer, known for crafting durable plate mail for the city guard and noble houses, while his mother was a devoted scholar of Herioreous' doctrine. From an early age, Aric was instilled with the values of duty, vigilance, and the sanctity of order.  
Unlike many other aasimar, whose celestial heritage manifests in grand visions or divine revelations, Aric’s connection to the divine was quiet and steady, like a smith’s hammer striking metal. He never heard the voice of Herioreous directly, but he felt his presence in the clang of steel, the discipline of the forge, and the unwavering duty of those who stood watch over others.

### **Turning Point**

As Aric grew, so too did his skill as a weaponsmith. Under his father’s guidance, he learned how to forge unbreakable blades, sturdy shields, and mastercrafted armor—but his life took a different path when a paladin of Herioreous came to their shop, seeking a weapon to combat a growing criminal syndicate in the city.  
That night, assassins came for the paladin. Aric, waking to the sounds of battle, took up a hammer and fought alongside the holy warrior, holding the line until reinforcements arrived. When the dust settled, the paladin looked upon Aric and said, "You are not just meant to forge weapons—you are meant to wield them in Herioreous' name."  
Taking this as a sign, Aric left behind the forge and took up the mantle of a cleric of Herioreous, swearing to dedicate his life to upholding law, protecting the innocent, and ensuring vigilance never falters.

  - He became **Aric’s first real mentor in the ways of Herioreous**, teaching him **how to fight and serve justice without arrogance**.
  - He was **killed by the same criminal syndicate** he was hunting—his death **remains one of Aric’s greatest regrets**, and he carries Aldric’s **old signet ring** as a reminder of his purpose.

- **High Priestess Callia Veyne** _(Cleric of Herioreous, Alive)_ – A **senior cleric** in Greyhawk who helped train Aric in divine magic.
  - A pragmatic woman, she often **warned Aric that Greyhawk is not a city of noble warriors—it is a city of power and survival**.
  - While she respects his ideals, she **worries he will not survive his own uncompromising nature**.

  - He **relies on Aric** for assistance when corruption makes things difficult.
  - However, he also warns Aric **not to make too many enemies—because the law in Greyhawk does not always protect the righteous**.

- **Sister Miriel Thorne** _(Paladin, Friend & Ally)_ – The **younger sister of Sir Aldric Thorne**, the paladin Aric once saved.

### **Current Role & Motivations**

Now a full-fledged cleric of Herioreous, Aric serves as a guardian and enforcer of order in Greyhawk. He operates from a modest chapel in the Garden Quarter, offering blessings to city guards, repairing arms and armor for the faithful, and ensuring that the laws of Herioreous are upheld. However, his path is not without conflict:

1. A Lawful But Neutral Stance – While Aric believes in law and duty, he recognizes that Greyhawk is full of corruption. He walks a fine line between enforcing order and questioning authority, ensuring that he does not become a pawn for the city’s more corrupt officials.
2. A Conflict with the Thieves’ Guild – Aric has openly opposed the Thieves’ Guild, refusing to provide them with weapons or protection. This has made him a target, with certain factions wanting him either silenced or bribed.
3. The Forgotten Duty – While he upholds law in Greyhawk, Aric’s celestial blood whispers that his duty extends beyond the city walls. There are greater evils and larger conflicts—perhaps Herioreous has greater plans for him than he realizes.

### **Long-Term Aspirations**

- **Short-Term Goals:**

  - **Continue rooting out corruption in Greyhawk** without falling into recklessness.
  - **Find proof that Gaius Vellcaro is behind many of Greyhawk’s crimes**.
  - **Track down Rennik "The Viper" and bring him to justice**.

- **Long-Term Goals:**

  - **Forge a legendary weapon in Herioreous’ name**, something worthy of passing down to future champions.
  - **Establish a true sanctuary in Greyhawk**, a **bastion of law and justice** that cannot be corrupted by politics.
  - **Resolve his conflict with his brother Darius**—either by proving that honor is the better path or **finding common ground**.
  - **Discover his celestial heritage’s true purpose**—is he meant to serve only Greyhawk, or **is there a greater battle on the horizon?**

- **Ultimate Aspirations:**
  - **Become a Champion of Herioreous**, **leading a force against true evil** beyond the city.
  - **Uncover an ancient artifact of Herioreous**, ensuring it is wielded by someone worthy.
  - **Leave behind a legacy**—whether by training a new generation, forging a divine relic, or ensuring Greyhawk remembers **his name and his deeds**.
