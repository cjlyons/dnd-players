## Back Story

### Early Life & Divine Calling

Born in the Artisan’s Quarter of Greyhawk, Aric Valdran was raised in a humble but disciplined household. His father was a master armorer, known for crafting durable plate mail for the city guard and noble houses, while his mother was a devoted scholar of Herioreous' doctrine. From an early age, Aric was instilled with the values of duty, vigilance, and the sanctity of order.  
Unlike many other aasimar, whose celestial heritage manifests in grand visions or divine revelations, Aric’s connection to the divine was quiet and steady, like a smith’s hammer striking metal. He never heard the voice of Herioreous directly, but he felt his presence in the clang of steel, the discipline of the forge, and the unwavering duty of those who stood watch over others.

### Turning Point

As Aric grew, so too did his skill as a weaponsmith. Under his father’s guidance, he learned how to forge unbreakable blades, sturdy shields, and mastercrafted armor—but his life took a different path when a paladin of Herioreous came to their shop, seeking a weapon to combat a growing criminal syndicate in the city.  
That night, assassins came for the paladin. Aric, waking to the sounds of battle, took up a hammer and fought alongside the holy warrior, holding the line until reinforcements arrived. When the dust settled, the paladin looked upon Aric and said, "You are not just meant to forge weapons—you are meant to wield them in Herioreous' name."  
Taking this as a sign, Aric left behind the forge and took up the mantle of a cleric of Herioreous, swearing to dedicate his life to upholding law, protecting the innocent, and ensuring vigilance never falters.

### Current Role & Motivations

Now a full-fledged cleric of Herioreous, Aric serves as a guardian and enforcer of order in Greyhawk. He operates from a modest chapel in the Garden Quarter, offering blessings to city guards, repairing arms and armor for the faithful, and ensuring that the laws of Herioreous are upheld. However, his path is not without conflict:

1. A Lawful But Neutral Stance – While Aric believes in law and duty, he recognizes that Greyhawk is full of corruption. He walks a fine line between enforcing order and questioning authority, ensuring that he does not become a pawn for the city’s more corrupt officials.
2. A Conflict with the Thieves’ Guild – Aric has openly opposed the Thieves’ Guild, refusing to provide them with weapons or protection. This has made him a target, with certain factions wanting him either silenced or bribed.
3. The Forgotten Duty – While he upholds law in Greyhawk, Aric’s celestial blood whispers that his duty extends beyond the city walls. There are greater evils and larger conflicts—perhaps Herioreous has greater plans for him than he realizes.

Personality & Traits

1. Disciplined & Stoic – Like a forge-hardened blade, Aric values self-control, patience, and discipline.
2. Unyielding in Duty – If he swears an oath, he will fulfill it, no matter the cost.
3. A Master of the Forge – Even as a cleric, Aric never abandoned his craftsmanship. He continues to forge weapons and armor, seeing them as sacred tools in the defense of order.
