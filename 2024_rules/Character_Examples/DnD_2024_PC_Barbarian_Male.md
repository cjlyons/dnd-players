## Back Story

### **Born to Battle**

Garruk Stonefury was born in the harsh, snow-laden peaks of the
Crystalmist Mountains, where only the strong survived. His tribe, the
Skybreakers, valued strength, endurance, and honor above all else. From
childhood, Garruk was raised on the philosophy of strength through
competition---a belief that only by constantly testing oneself against
others could a warrior truly grow.

By the time he was of age, Garruk had already earned a name for himself
among his people, winning countless contests of wrestling,
stone-lifting, foot races across treacherous cliffs, and brutal sparring
matches. But his hunger for challenge went beyond sport. He trained as a
warrior of the Skybreakers, standing as a guardian against those who
dared to threaten his people---whether it be the roving bands of orcs,
the raiders from the lowlands, or the harshness of the wild itself.

### **A Spirit That Couldn't Be Contained**

Yet, no matter how many battles he fought or challenges he conquered,
Garruk felt a growing restlessness. His tribe was small, and their
battles were the same battles fought for generations. He had bested
every rival, lifted every boulder, and outrun every challenger. He
longed for more---for greater foes, grander trials, and a place where
his strength could be truly tested.

One night, beneath the full moon, he stood atop the highest peak near
Gorna, looking out beyond the mountains. The wind whispered to him of
the great city of Greyhawk, a place where warriors from every land
clashed, where adventurers sought glory, and where battle was never far
away. His fate lay beyond the mountains.

### **Arrival in Greyhawk**

The transition from tribal warrior to city dweller was no easy feat.
Garruk found the laws and customs of the city strange, the people small
and fragile, and the fights\... far less honorable than those among his
tribe. But he adapted, learning the ways of mercenaries, gladiators, and
sellswords.

1.  He joined underground fighting pits, earning coin and fame with his
    sheer strength and unbreakable will.

2.  He took on mercenary work, guarding caravans and noble
    houses---though he quickly grew frustrated with "standing around"
    rather than fighting.

3.  He found a band of adventurers, warriors who sought danger,
    treasure, and battle, and knew that this was where he belonged.

### **Personality & Beliefs**

1.  Loyal & Pragmatic -- Though he has embraced the chaos of adventure,
    Garruk still follows the Goliath code of honor: trust must be
    earned, oaths must be kept, and strength is to be respected.

2.  Competitive & Boastful -- Whether it's arm-wrestling in a tavern or
    slaying a monstrous foe, Garruk never misses a chance to prove
    himself. He keeps a running list of his greatest victories and will
    eagerly tell anyone who listens.

3.  Thrives on Challenge -- He doesn't seek bloodshed for bloodshed's
    sake, but he believes that only through struggle can one become
    truly strong.
