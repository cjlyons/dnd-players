## **🔥 A Noble Born in Shadow – House Kaelmont of Rauxes**

Zerathis "Zer" Kaelmont was born into **House Kaelmont**, a **lesser noble house** of Rauxes, once loyal to the **ruling Naelax dynasty**. Though **not royalty**, the Kaelmonts were **powerful and feared**, known for their **swordmasters, spies, and infernal scholars**.

The **Kaelmont family’s fortune** came from their **service as enforcers and assassins** for the Overking. While the **Naelax ruled through terror**, the **Kaelmonts ensured obedience**—silencing rivals, overseeing infernal pacts, and **training elite warriors who wielded both steel and sorcery**.

## **🏛️ House Kaelmont – A Legacy of Blood & Fire**

- The **Kaelmont name carried weight** in Rauxes, though always in the **shadows** of greater houses.
- Their warriors **mastered both swordplay and infernal magic**, trained to be **executioners, duelists, and bodyguards to the Naelax elite**.
- They **kept a dark secret**—a **blood pact with an infernal lord of Gehenna**, passed down through their lineage.

Zerathis was **heir to this legacy**—raised as a **warrior, duelist, and court manipulator**, meant to serve **House Naelax and enforce their will**.

But then, **Rauxes fell**.

## **🔥 The Fall of Rauxes – A Betrayal & an Infernal Bargain**

**The Year 586 CY – The Cataclysm of Rauxes**

- On the **day of the empire’s destruction**, **House Kaelmont prepared to flee**—they **knew something was coming**.
- **Zerathis’ father, Lord Evand Kaelmont**, betrayed House Naelax, hoping to **sever the family’s infernal contract** and **escape the curse that loomed over them**.
- But **the pact could not be broken**. The infernal patron of House Kaelmont, a **devil of Gehenna known as Xeltharion**, **claimed what was owed**.
- **Evand Kaelmont was consumed in hellfire**, but **the debt did not vanish**—instead, the fiend **turned to Zerathis.**
- _“Your father failed. But you, boy, you are worthy. Our contract is unfinished.”_

🔥 **The Infernal Mark:** In the chaos, **Zerathis was branded by Xeltharion**, marking him as the **next inheritor of the Kaelmont pact**. But instead of **fully binding him**, the devil **let him escape**, whispering:  
 _“I will collect what is mine, in time.”_

The **ruin of Rauxes swallowed the city**. The **Naelax dynasty perished**, but **Zer survived**—**marked, cursed, and alone**.

---

## **⚔️ Exile & Survival – A Noble Without a House**

Zer spent **years in exile**, wandering as a **sword-for-hire, gambler, and duelist**, trying to **outrun his past**. But **no matter how far he goes, he cannot escape Xeltharion’s mark**.

Eventually, he found himself in **Greyhawk**, the **Free City**, where **the past matters less than your skill and ambition**. Here, he **reinvented himself** as a **fighter-for-hire**, keeping his true name buried beneath layers of deception.

But the **whispers in his soul never faded**. The **power within him still stirs**, waiting to be claimed.

Bringing **Zerathis Kaelmont** to life in roleplay means emphasizing his **noble background, infernal heritage, and inner conflict** while keeping his **charisma, cunning, and combat prowess** at the forefront. Here’s how to play him effectively:

---

## **🎭 Roleplaying Strategies for Zerathis Kaelmont**

### **1. Noble Bearing, Even in Exile**

Zer **was raised in privilege**—even though he’s a mercenary now, his **demeanor should still reflect nobility**:  
✅ **Speaks with confidence**—rarely stammers or hesitates, even when lying.  
✅ **Commands respect**—he expects to be listened to, even by those who don’t know his name.  
✅ **Maintains etiquette**—he’ll **address people formally** unless he’s mocking them.  
✅ **Rarely grovels**—even when outmatched, he tries to **bargain, negotiate, or intimidate** rather than beg.

🔹 _Example RP:_  
_Zerathis smirks as the orcish thug steps forward._  
_"I’ll give you one chance, brute. Stand down and walk away with your teeth… or kneel and offer me your blade. You have three seconds."_

---

### **2. The Charismatic Duelist**

As a trained **fighter and manipulator**, Zer should **enjoy the thrill of high-stakes situations**—whether in **combat, gambling, or social intrigue**.  
✅ **Gambles frequently**—3-Dragon Ante should be a staple of his downtime.  
✅ **Enjoys testing people**—might challenge a proud warrior to a friendly spar or provoke an arrogant noble with wordplay.  
✅ **Uses wit in combat**—he might taunt an opponent mid-fight or offer them a chance to surrender.

🔹 _Example RP (Gambling):_  
_"Fortune is a fickle thing, friend. But skill? That I trust. Care to test your luck? Let’s raise the stakes—your coin… for a secret."_

🔹 _Example RP (Combat):_  
_"You're swinging that blade like a farmer with a scythe. Shall I show you how a noble fights?"_

---

### **3. The Infernal Shadow – A Devil’s Whispers**

Zer **hears the voice of Xeltharion, his infernal patron**. He doesn’t always acknowledge it, but it’s **always there**, lurking at the edge of his mind.  
✅ **Occasionally pauses, as if listening to something others don’t hear.**  
✅ **Echoes some of the patron’s phrases**—it’s slowly influencing his speech.  
✅ **Struggles with temptation**—does he take the easy path of power or fight against it?

🔹 _Example RP:_  
_(After winning a battle, standing over a defeated enemy.)_  
_Xeltharion’s voice echoes in his mind: “Take their soul. Claim their strength.”_  
_Zer flexes his fingers, his eyes flickering with hellfire—then exhales sharply._  
_"Not yet."_

---

### **4. Hiding His Past – A Name Too Dangerous to Speak**

Zerathis Kaelmont is **not a name he gives freely**.  
✅ **Uses a false name when meeting new people**—“Zer,” “Zane,” or “Kael.”  
✅ **Avoids talking about Rauxes unless absolutely necessary.**  
✅ **May react coldly to anyone who pries into his past.**

🔹 _Example RP:_  
_When asked about his past:_  
_"Oh, my childhood? Farms, fields, good honest work. Absolutely nothing scandalous, no, of course not."_ _(quickly changes the subject)._

---

### **5. The Redemption vs. Damnation Struggle**

His story arc is about **choosing between embracing his infernal power or resisting it**.  
✅ **At first, he will refuse to use magic.**  
✅ **The first time he casts an eldritch blast, he should react—shocked, conflicted, or tempted.**  
✅ **Slowly starts referring to the patron more often, willingly or unwillingly.**  
✅ **His voice and demeanor may subtly shift over time, becoming colder or more intense as the fiend’s influence grows.**

🔹 _Example RP (First Time Using Magic):_  
_(A sudden blast of crimson energy erupts from his palm, incinerating his enemy.)_  
_Zer looks down at his own hand, flexing his fingers, eyes wide._  
_"…No. No, not yet."_ _(He shakes it off, but the fire still lingers in his palm before fading.)_

✅ **Keeps his weapons meticulously clean—it’s a noble’s discipline.**  
✅ **Has a specific way of drinking wine—appreciates the taste, never rushes.**
