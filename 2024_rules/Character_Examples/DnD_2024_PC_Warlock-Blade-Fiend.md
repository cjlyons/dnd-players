## **A Noble Born in Shadow – House Kaelmont of Rauxes**

Zerathis "Zer" Kaelmont was born into **House Kaelmont**, a **lesser noble house** of Rauxes, once loyal to the **ruling Naelax dynasty**. Though **not royalty**, the Kaelmonts were **powerful and feared**, known for their **swordmasters, spies, and infernal scholars**.

The **Kaelmont family’s fortune** came from their **service as enforcers and assassins** for the Overking. While the **Naelax ruled through terror**, the **Kaelmonts ensured obedience**—silencing rivals, overseeing infernal pacts, and **training elite warriors who wielded both steel and sorcery**.

## **House Kaelmont – A Legacy of Blood & Fire**

- The **Kaelmont name carried weight** in Rauxes, though always in the **shadows** of greater houses.
- Their warriors **mastered both swordplay and infernal magic**, trained to be **executioners, duelists, and bodyguards to the Naelax elite**.
- They **kept a dark secret**—a **blood pact with an infernal lord of Gehenna**, passed down through their lineage.

Zerathis was **heir to this legacy**—raised as a **warrior, duelist, and court manipulator**, meant to serve **House Naelax and enforce their will**.

But then, **Rauxes fell**.

---

## **The Fall of Rauxes – A Betrayal & an Infernal Bargain**

**The Year 586 CY – The Cataclysm of Rauxes**

- On the **day of the empire’s destruction**, **House Kaelmont prepared to flee**—they **knew something was coming**.
- **Zerathis’ father, Lord Evand Kaelmont**, betrayed House Naelax, hoping to **sever the family’s infernal contract** and **escape the curse that loomed over them**.
- But **the pact could not be broken**. The infernal patron of House Kaelmont, a **devil of Gehenna known as Xeltharion**, **claimed what was owed**.
- **Evand Kaelmont was consumed in hellfire**, but **the debt did not vanish**—instead, the fiend **turned to Zerathis.**
- _“Your father failed. But you, boy, you are worthy. Our contract is unfinished.”_

**The Infernal Mark:** In the chaos, **Zerathis was branded by Xeltharion**, marking him as the **next inheritor of the Kaelmont pact**. But instead of **fully binding him**, the devil **let him escape**, whispering:  
 _“I will collect what is mine, in time.”_

The **ruin of Rauxes swallowed the city**. The **Naelax dynasty perished**, but **Zer survived**—**marked, cursed, and alone**.

---

## **Exile & Survival – A Noble Without a House**

Zer spent **years in exile**, wandering as a **sword-for-hire, gambler, and duelist**, trying to **outrun his past**. But **no matter how far he goes, he cannot escape Xeltharion’s mark**.

Eventually, he found himself in **Greyhawk**, the **Free City**, where **the past matters less than your skill and ambition**. Here, he **reinvented himself** as a **fighter-for-hire**, keeping his true name buried beneath layers of deception.

But the **whispers in his soul never faded**. The **power within him still stirs**, waiting to be claimed.

---

## **Important People in Zer’s Life**

1. **Lord Evand Kaelmont (Father – Deceased?)**
   - **Tried to break the infernal pact**, failed, and was **consumed in fire**.
   - Zer **hates him** for his weakness, but also **wonders if he was right to try**.
2. **Dalos "Luckhand" Rehn (Gambler & Informant in Greyhawk)**
   - A **half-elf trickster** who runs **underground gambling rings**.
   - Zer’s **closest friend**, often **drinking and playing 3-Dragon Ante together**.
3. **Renza Kael (Former Kaelmont Swordmaster, Now a Mercenary)**
   - **Once Zer’s combat tutor**, now a **mercenary in Greyhawk**.
   - She **knows Zer’s past** and may try to **exploit or protect him**.
4. **Xeltharion (Infernal Patron, Devil of Gehenna)**
   - A **powerful fiend** who **marked Zer in Rauxes**.
   - It **has not fully claimed him—yet**.

---

## **Fighter Now, Warlock Soon – The Transition**

- Zer **trains as a fighter** because **he does not want to give in to his infernal bloodline**.
- He **uses steel, wit, and skill** to survive—**magic is the path of his cursed family**.
- But **Xeltharion still lingers**, and **Zer cannot deny the power within him forever**.
- When he finally **accepts his infernal heritage**, the **pact-blade will awaken**.

---

## **Goals & Motivations**

- **Understand His Mark** – **What does Xeltharion want? Can he fight its influence?**

### **Long-Term Aspirations**

**Break or Master the Pact** – He must **either control his infernal power or be consumed by it**.  
**Unlock the Truth of Rauxes** – Was his **father right**? **Could the Kaelmont pact have been severed?**  
**Reclaim or Destroy His Family Legacy** – Does he **embrace his noble heritage or erase it forever?**

---

## **Roleplaying Hooks & Traits**

**Charming but Cautious** – He is **persuasive and charismatic**, but always **measures his words**.  
**Loves High-Stakes Games** – A **master of deception and gambling**, especially **3-Dragon Ante**.  
**Fears His Infernal Power** – He **resents the fiend’s influence**, but **part of him craves the power**.  
**Fights with Precision** – He **does not waste movement**, his dueling style is **efficient, brutal, and elegant**.  
**Hears the Patron’s Whispers** – When alone, he sometimes **hears the voice of Xeltharion**.

---

## **Final Question: Redemption or Damnation?**

Will **Zerathis Kaelmont** **embrace the power of his infernal bloodline**, forging a **new legacy of strength and ambition**?

Or will he **fight against the chains of his heritage**, seeking **redemption and freedom** from the devils that **claimed his ancestors**?

His **story is one of choice, power, and the fine line between control and corruption**.
