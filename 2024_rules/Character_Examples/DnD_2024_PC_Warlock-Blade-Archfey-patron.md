---

Kaelorâ€™s patron is **The Queen of Tempests**, a **mysterious and powerful Archfey** who rules over **the Everstorm**, a realm where **whispering winds carry secrets, lightning sings, and the sky itself bends to her will**.

---

### **Name & Titles**

- **The Queen of Tempests**
- **She-Who-Walks-The-Wind**
- **Stormmother of the Feywild**
- **The Whispering Gale**

---

### **Appearance**

The **Queen of Tempests** is **a being of shifting, ethereal beauty**, her form **ever-changing like the storm she commands**.

- Her **hair is a flowing mass of silver mist and storm clouds**, crackling with **lightning that flickers and arcs across her shoulders**.
- Her **skin is pale like moonlit fog**, shimmering with an **inner glow** that shifts between **calm radiance and furious stormlight**.
- Her **eyes are twin stormfronts**, endless **tempests swirling within**, flickering between **deep sapphire and brilliant emerald**.
- She wears a **flowing cloak woven from the night sky**, trailing behind her like a **stormâ€™s wake**, embroidered with **patterns of golden lightning and shifting constellations**.

When she **speaks**, her voice is **the wind itself**, sometimes a **gentle whisper in the breeze**, other times **a deafening clap of thunder that shakes the sky**.

---

### **Domain & Realm**

She rules over **the Everstorm**, a **vast, ever-changing sky-realm within the Feywild** where **floating islands drift through endless clouds**, and **lightning arcs through the mist** like veins of fire.

- **In the Queenâ€™s Court, storms have a will of their own**, bending to **the whims of the wind**.
- **The air is alive with whispers**, carrying **secrets stolen from every storm that has ever passed over the world**.
- Her palace, **The Skyforged Spire**, is an **impossible structure of cloudstone and flickering lightning**, hovering over an **infinite vortex of wind and rain**.

Some say her court is home to **exiled storm giants, fey knights bound to the wind, and whispering spirits of lost travelers**.

---

### **Personality & Motivations**

The **Queen of Tempests** is neither wholly benevolent nor cruelâ€”she is a force of **freedom, chaos, and destiny**.

- **She does not grant power freely**â€”she expects those who bear her gift to **prove themselves worthy**.
- **She is drawn to souls who are lost to the storm**, those who **seek purpose beyond what they were given**.
- She speaks in **prophecies and riddles**, never revealing **her full intent**, instead offering **guidance like shifting windsâ€”uncertain, yet always leading somewhere**.
- She **despises stagnation and oppression**, seeing **rigid law and tradition as chains upon the soul**.

To serve her is to **embrace the storm**, to **walk where the wind takes you**, and to **never let the world decide your fate**.

---

### **Why She Chose Kaelor**

Kaelor **was marked before he ever left Skyhold**.

- The **storm within his blood**, the **wandererâ€™s spirit**, the **defiance of tradition**â€”these were all **signs** that he belonged to **something greater than his fatherâ€™s rigid path**.
- She **whispered to him in the caves beneath High Ery**, when the wind carried **words he could not yet understand**.
- She **tested him**, letting him **face the darkness of corruption and the wild fury of the bear**, to see **if he would yield or stand unshaken**.

When he **slept beneath the stars on the journey home**, she **reached out**, offering him a **choice**:

_"You seek your purpose in the sky. But storms do not bow, and the wind does not ask permission to roam. Take my gift, and forge your own path in the tempest."_

When Kaelor **awoke**, the **air smelled of ozone**, and **his dreams were filled with lightning**.

He would **never see the world the same way again**.

---

### **Boons & Powers She Grants**

As **her chosen**, Kaelor will gain **fragments of her storm-born magic**, a reflection of her **wild, unpredictable nature**:

- **The Whispering Wind** â€“ He can **hear words carried on the wind**, sometimes whispers of **distant conversations, old secrets, or fey prophecies**.
- **The Tempestâ€™s Touch** â€“ His **magic carries the essence of the storm**, bending the **wind and lightning to his will**.
- **The Stormborn Pact** â€“ When he fights, **thunder rolls in the distance**, and the **air crackles with unseen energy**â€”as if the **Everstorm itself watches through him**.

---

### **Kaelorâ€™s Role as Her Warlock**

- He is not a **servant**, but a **herald of the storm**.
- He is meant to **challenge fate**, to **test the strong**, and to **carve a path where none existed**.
- The Queen does not demand **obedience**â€”she demands **action**. **To stand still is to be swept away**.

His new **warlock powers** are not a **gift freely given**â€”they are a **bargain, a promise**. He will **embrace the storm**, or **be lost in it**.

The **Queen of Tempests** is the perfect patron for Kaelor because she embodies **freedom, defiance, and destiny**â€”all things that define his journey.

- **His exile was not a lossâ€”it was a beginning.**
- **His power was never meant to be shackled by Skyholdâ€™s laws.**
- **The storm calls him forward, and now, he answers.**

### **Queen of Tempests: Alliances**

The **Queen of Tempests** is **neither fully Seelie nor Unseelie**â€”she **exists between them**, much like the **storms that shift between calm and chaos**.

However, **if forced to choose**, she would be considered **Unseelie**, but **not in the way mortals understand**.

---

#### **Her Alignment in the Fey Courts**

- **She does not align with the Seelie Court**, as they value **order, beauty, and structure**, while she **revels in unpredictability, freedom, and change**.
- The **Unseelie Court** embraces **chaos and wild nature**, but many of its rulers are **cruel and manipulative**, traits she does **not fully embody**.
- Instead, she is **a force of nature**, more akin to a **rogue power among the Fey**, **unpredictable and wild**, with **her own agenda**.

She is sometimes called **"The Unbound Queen"** because she refuses to **swear loyalty to either court**, much to the frustration of both.

---

#### **Her Relationship with the Unseelie Court**

- The **Unseelie Court** respects her power but sees her as **a wild storm that cannot be controlled**.
- Some **Unseelie Lords** have tried to **bind her or claim her power**, but all have failedâ€”those who tried met their fate in **lightning-scorched ruin**.
- She is known to **oppose some of the darker Unseelie Lords**, particularly those who seek **dominion over mortals or nature itself**.
- She **does not revel in cruelty**, but she **does believe in the harshness of fate**â€”a storm **destroys without bias**, and so does she.

---

#### **Her View on the Seelie & Unseelie Courts**

- **"The Seelie cling to the illusion of order. The Unseelie worship chaos. I am the storm between themâ€”both, and neither."**
- She often **tests both sides**, sending **storms across their lands**, reminding them that **no throne is beyond the reach of the wind**.
- She has been courted by **both** Seelie and Unseelie rulers, but she has **never bowed to another**.

---

#### **How This Affects Kaelor**

- As **her warlock**, Kaelor is **not tied to the Unseelie Court**, but he **will be viewed as an agent of an unpredictable force**.
- Fey creatures, **especially those aligned with Seelie or Unseelie politics**, may **mistrust or respect him**, depending on how they view his patron.
- Some **Unseelie Lords may try to manipulate or test him**, while Seelie **may see him as dangerous but not entirely hostile**.
- He is **a wanderer in the storm, answering to no court but his own fate**.

---

#### **Unseelieâ€¦ But Not Fully**

The **Queen of Tempests** is **technically Unseelie**, but she **does not belong to their court**. She is a **rogue force of nature, respected and feared** by both Seelie and Unseelie alike.

Kaelor, as her chosen warlock, is **not bound to the darkness of the Unseelie** but **stands at the edge of their world, wielding the power of the untamed storm**.

### **Rivals & Allies of the Queen of Tempests**

The **Queen of Tempests** exists **between the Seelie and Unseelie Courts**, neither fully belonging to either, yet feared and respected by both.

Her **storm-born power** makes her both a **dangerous enemy and a valuable ally**, and many Fey lords and ladies **seek to claim, destroy, or manipulate her**.

---

#### **ðŸ’  Her Allies**

While she does not **swear fealty to any**, there are a few powerful beings in the **Feywild** who see her as **an ally, a kindred spirit, or an unpredictable force they can call upon in times of need**.

---

##### **1. The Lord of the West Wind** _(Seelie, Neutral Good)_

- A **noble and free-spirited archfey**, ruling over **the Windswept Expanse**, a realm of **rolling grasslands and endless sky**.
- He **delights in the Queenâ€™s chaotic nature**, seeing her as a **force that reminds the Fey of the wild beauty of freedom**.
- Unlike other Seelie Lords, he does not seek to **control her power**â€”instead, he values **the unpredictable storm, knowing that both wind and lightning bring renewal**.
- He has **lent his forces to her in past battles** against Unseelie threats, though he **knows better than to expect her loyalty in return**.

###### **How He Affects Kaelor:**

- The **Lord of the West Wind** may take an **interest in Kaelor**, seeing him as **a warrior who embodies both discipline and chaos**.
- If Kaelor **proves himself worthy**, the West Wind may **offer gifts or insight**, but he will **never try to command him**â€”only guide him.

---

##### **2. The Storm-Touched Giants** _(Cloud & Storm Giants, Unaligned)_

- Some **Storm Giants and Cloud Giants** believe that the **Queen of Tempests is an ancient ally of their kind**, a **remnant of a pact lost to time**.
- They **do not worship her**, but some revere her as **a sign of great change**, and **those who dream of the future sometimes claim to hear her whispers in the thunder**.
- A few **Cloud Giant seers and Storm Giant oracles** have sought her out for **visions of what is to come**, though **whether she answers them depends on her whims**.

###### **How They Affect Kaelor:**

- Some **Storm Giants may recognize his bond to the Queen**, seeing it as a **mark of destiny**.
- Others may **seek to test him**, believing that **the storm must be proven, not simply wielded**.
- He may come across **ancient cloud giant ruins** that **whisper secrets of the Queenâ€™s past dealings with their ancestors**.

---

##### **3. The Dancer in the Fog** _(Unseelie, Chaotic Neutral)_

- A strange **Unseelie fey**, neither warrior nor ruler, but a **being of shifting mist and illusion**.
- She is said to be **a keeper of forgotten roads, a guide through the unknown**, and **a speaker of truths wrapped in riddles**.
- The Queen of Tempests **does not trust her, yet they share a bond**â€”a respect for the power of the **unpredictable**.
- When the **Everstorm rages, the Fog Dancerâ€™s veil thickens**, and the two archfey have **danced between war and friendship for centuries**.

###### **How She Affects Kaelor:**

- The **Dancer in the Fog** may try to **test him**, leading him into **traps, riddles, or strange Fey bargains**.
- She **may not wish him harm**, but she will **never tell him the whole truth**.
- If he learns to **navigate her illusions**, she may **offer him passage into places few mortals tread**.

---

#### **âš¡ Her Rivals & Enemies**

The Queen of Tempests has made **powerful enemies**â€”some seek to **control her**, others wish to **see her fall**, and a few simply **despise what she represents**.

---

##### **1. The Lord of Iron & Silence** _(Unseelie, Lawful Evil)_

- A **dark Unseelie ruler**, obsessed with **order, obedience, and the crushing of all chaotic forces**.
- He **believes that storms are wild, dangerous, and must be shackled**â€”he seeks to **bind the Queen of Tempests and make her power his own**.
- His **realm, the Cold Iron Keep**, is a place where **wind does not blow, and the sky is eternally gray**.
- He has sent **hunters, assassins, and storm-catchers** after the Queen **for centuries**, seeking to **steal the storm for himself**.

###### **How He Affects Kaelor:**

- His agents may **hunt Kaelor**, seeking to **snuff out the stormâ€™s growing influence** before he can **become a true force of chaos**.
- If Kaelor **becomes strong enough**, the Lord of Iron may **attempt to bargain with him**, offering **power in exchange for turning against the Queen**.

---

##### **2. The Howling Huntress** _(Seelie, Neutral Evil)_

- A **ruthless Seelie warrior**, once a noble fey knight, now a **storm-hunter who believes she alone should command the sky**.
- She **despises the Queen of Tempests**, believing that **the storm is wasted on a fickle fey who refuses to use it with purpose**.
- She **rides a mount made of thunderclouds**, wielding **a spear forged from lightning itself**, and **hunts anything that tries to claim the stormâ€™s power**.

###### **How She Affects Kaelor:**

- If she learns of **Kaelorâ€™s pact**, she may **seek to challenge him**â€”not to kill him, but to **test whether he is worthy of the storm**.
- If Kaelor **defeats her or impresses her**, she may **offer a powerful reward** or a **rivalry that lasts for years**.

---

##### **3. The Keeper of Stillness** _(Ancient Fey, True Neutral)_

- An **enigmatic, ancient being**, neither Seelie nor Unseelie, but something **older**â€”a guardian of **silence, stillness, and the death of movement**.
- The **Keeper sees storms as unnatural**, believing that **all things must return to quiet in time**.
- They do not seek to **destroy the Queen**, but **to remind her that all tempests must end**.
- Their presence is felt in the **deepest still waters, the breath before thunder strikes, and the quiet after a storm has passed**.

###### **How They Affect Kaelor:**

- If Kaelorâ€™s **power grows too wild**, the **Keeper of Stillness may appear**, offering **a warning that all storms eventually die**.
- They may **challenge Kaelor with moments of silence**, stripping him of his **storm-given strength in places of deep stillness**.
- If he ever **enters their domain**, he may find that **his powers wane, and the Queen of Tempests does not answer his call**.

---

#### **Final Thoughts: A Warlock in the Storm**

Kaelor will not **just be a warlock**â€”he will be a **piece in the shifting power struggles of the Feywild**, whether he wants to be or not.

- Some will **seek to use him**, believing that he is **a means to controlling the storm**.
- Others will **hunt him**, fearing that **he is the storm given mortal form**.
- And a rare few will **offer guidance, challenges, or wisdom**, hoping that he **forges his own path through the tempest**.
