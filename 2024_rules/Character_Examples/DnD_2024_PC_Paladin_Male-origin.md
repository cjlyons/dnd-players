# **The Pomarj: A Land of Brutality and Chaos**

The **Pomarj** is a wild, dangerous, and war-torn land located **south of Greyhawk**, across the **Woolly Bay**. It was once a prosperous human region, but over the centuries, it has become a **lawless realm dominated by orcs, goblins, and bandits**. It is now infamous as a **stronghold of evil**, ruled by savage warlords, slavers, and raiding bands who terrorize the surrounding lands.

## **HISTORY OF THE POMARJ**

### **1) The Prosperous Human Era** (Pre-300 CY)

Originally, the Pomarj was settled by **Flan, Oeridian, and Suel humans**, forming small independent city-states and fortresses. It was a rugged but fertile land, and many **mining colonies** thrived due to its rich deposits of **iron, silver, and gems**.

### **2) The Ulek Occupation** (~300 CY)

The **Duchy of Ulek** (a lawful elven and dwarven kingdom) expanded into the Pomarj, annexing it and bringing it under their rule. **Dwarves and humans** built many **fortified settlements** to guard against humanoid raids from the mountains.

### **3) The Great Humanoid Uprising** (513 CY)

This was the turning point. A massive **orc and goblinoid uprising**, fueled by the warlord **Turrosh Mak**, swept through the region. The **Ulek garrisons were slaughtered**, and the Pomarj fell **almost entirely into humanoid control**.

### **4) The Rule of Warlords and Slavers** (Present Day)

Now, the Pomarj is **divided among warring orc chieftains, human slavers, and monstrous warlords**. The region is infamous for its **slave trade**, and its raiders constantly strike the Wild Coast, Ulek, and even Greyhawk.

## **CULTURE & SOCIETY IN THE POMARJ**

### **1) A Brutal, Might-Makes-Right Society**

- Strength is the only law. **Warlords and chieftains** hold power through force, and those too weak to defend themselves are **enslaved or killed**.
- There is **no unified government**—instead, there are many **warring factions**.
- **Orcs, goblins, and ogres** dominate, but humans and other races exist, often as **mercenaries, war slaves, or exiles**.

### **2) The Strongest Lead—For Now**

- Warlords rise and fall **quickly**, their **power depending on the loyalty of their warriors**.
- Some orc tribes attempt **military discipline**, but most rely on brute force.
- Treachery is common—leaders who show weakness are **assassinated or overthrown**.

### **3) Slavery and Raiding Are a Way of Life**

- The Pomarj is **infamous for its slavers**. Many bandit warlords work with the **Slave Lords**, an evil organization that sells captives across the Flanaess.
- Raids against nearby lands, especially the **Wild Coast, Ulek, and Greyhawk**, are common.

### **4) A Harsh, Unforgiving Land**

- The Pomarj is filled with **rocky hills, deep caves, and ruined forts**. The land is **poor for farming**, making plunder and war **the only real economy**.
- Some mines still operate, controlled by powerful warlords or **enslaved labor forces**.
