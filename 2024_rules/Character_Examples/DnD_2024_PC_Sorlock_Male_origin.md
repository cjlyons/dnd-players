Zyra’s upbringing as a **merchant’s apprentice and wanderer** means he was exposed to **a variety of regions** throughout the **Flanaess**. His knowledge of trade routes, cultures, and hidden corners of the world makes him an adventurer at heart. Here’s a look at the places that influenced his life:

---

## **1. City of Greyhawk (Zyra’s Home Base)**

- **The bustling heart of trade, knowledge, and intrigue.**
- Zyra’s **family ran a trade business**, dealing in rare goods, magical items, and artifacts.
- He **learned haggling, negotiation, and deception** from his time in the city’s merchant circles.
- Likely spent time in:
  - **The River Quarter** – A rougher, dockside area where smugglers and mercenaries gather.
  - **The Grand Bazaar** – The city’s sprawling market where merchants and con artists alike ply their trade.
  - **The Garden Quarter** – Where scholars and minor nobles reside; Zyra probably had dealings with minor wizards or collectors seeking **rare magical curiosities**.
- **Trouble in Greyhawk:** Zyra may have **angered a noble or guild** with a bad deal or smuggling job gone wrong. This could be why he left.

---

## **2. The Wild Roads & Trade Routes of the Flanaess**

Zyra didn’t just stay in Greyhawk—his family’s **merchant caravans and riverboats** took him **all over the central Flanaess**.

### **A. The Selintan River (Greyhawk’s Lifeblood)**

- The **river trade route** that connects Greyhawk to the Nyr Dyv (_the Lake of Unknown Depths_).
- Zyra spent **countless days on riverboats**, learning **sailing, smuggling tricks, and Feywild myths** from traveling sailors.
- **Major Stops Along the River:**
  - **Ford Keep** – A fortified garrison town where mercenaries protect merchant caravans.
  - **Dyvers** – A city of **free-trading merchants and cutthroat dealmakers**, where Zyra learned how to spot a scam.
  - **Narwell** – A rough frontier town where he probably had **dealings with bandits**.

### **B. The Bright Desert (A Dangerous Crossing)**

- South of Greyhawk lies the **Bright Desert**, a scorching wasteland ruled by the **archmage Rary**.
- Zyra’s caravan sometimes traded with **desert nomads**, seeking rare spices, relics, or magical crystals.
- This is where he first heard rumors of **a lost draconic city**, buried beneath the sands—something he still dreams of finding.

### **C. The Gnarley Forest & Fey Crossroads**

- A dense, ancient forest west of Greyhawk, **full of fey creatures, druids, and hidden magic**.
- **Zyra’s first real experience with the Feywild** happened here—perhaps he stumbled into a **crossing** long before his pact with Titania.
- Some say the deeper parts of the forest contain **time-warping groves, eternal twilight glades, and hidden courts of the Seelie and Unseelie fey**.

---

## **3. The Enchanted Glade (Where He Made His Pact)**

- Somewhere along a **trade route**, Zyra wandered off and found himself **in a fey-touched glade, caught between worlds**.
- The **sky shimmered with golden twilight**, and the air was filled with the sound of distant music.
- It was here that **Titania, Queen of the Summer Court**, appeared before him, offering power in exchange for service.
- The glade is **hidden**, but **Zyra might one day return to it—if he can find the way back**.

---

## **4. The Feywild Influence**

- Even after leaving the glade, **fey magic clung to Zyra**.
- Some places in the world **feel different to him now—shimmering slightly, filled with whispers just beyond hearing.**
- He sometimes **sees doors, mirrors, or ponds flicker with strange reflections**—as if they could lead somewhere else.
