# **D&D Session 0: Establishing the Game Before the Adventure Begins**

A **Session 0** is the foundation of a great Dungeons & Dragons campaign. It’s a **pre-game meeting where the DM and players align expectations, create characters, and discuss the themes, tone, and rules of the game**. This session ensures that **everyone is on the same page before the first dice roll**, setting up an engaging, collaborative, and enjoyable experience for all.

---

### **1. Setting Expectations and Tone** 🎭

The DM should discuss the **overall feel of the campaign**, including:

- **Setting and Genre** – Is this a **high-fantasy epic, gritty survival, dark mystery, political intrigue, or a comedy-filled adventure**?
- **Tone and Themes** – Will the game be **serious, lighthearted, heroic, morally complex, or horror-driven**?
- **House Rules & Rule Clarifications** – Any **DM-specific mechanics, homebrew rules, or modified features** should be agreed upon.
- **Pacing & Playstyle** – Will this be **combat-heavy, exploration-focused, or roleplay-intensive**?

💡 _Example:_ _“This campaign takes place in a dark and mysterious world filled with intrigue, where politics and war shape the fate of nations. Expect a balance of roleplay, combat, and mystery-solving.”_

---

### **2. Player & DM Expectations** 🤝

D&D is a collaborative experience, so the group should discuss:

- **How much roleplay does everyone enjoy?**
- **Is combat tactical, fast-paced, or more cinematic?**
- **How do we handle in-character conflict?** (e.g., can characters argue? What about PvP?)
- **What’s the party dynamic?** Are you **working together from the start or forming uneasy alliances?**
- **How often will we meet, and how long are sessions?**
- **How do we handle absences?** (Reschedule, play without, or NPC the missing character?)

💡 _Example:_ _“This game will lean into deep roleplay, but combat will still play a major role. PvP is discouraged unless both players agree on it beforehand.”_

---

### **3. Character Creation & Party Composition** 🎭

Session 0 is the time to:

- **Build characters together**, ensuring a balanced party with shared goals.
  - Use the [Character Creation Guide](./character-creation.md) to help undersand the process and get ideas
- **Discuss backstories and connections**—do the characters already know each other?
- **Align motivations**—why is your character joining this adventure?
- **Coordinate abilities**—avoiding four rogues and no healers (unless that’s the plan!).

💡 _Example:_ _“Your characters all grew up in the same city and have been hired for the same job. You don’t have to like each other, but you need a reason to work together.”_

---

### **4. Table Etiquette & Boundaries** 🚦

To ensure a respectful and safe game, the group should:

- **Set boundaries on uncomfortable topics** (e.g., phobias, sensitive subjects).
- **Use safety tools** like the X-card or lines and veils.
- **Decide how to handle disputes**—usually deferring to DM rulings.
- **Agree on out-of-game etiquette** (e.g., side conversations, phone use, and staying engaged).

💡 _Example:_ _“If anything comes up that makes you uncomfortable, let’s use the ‘pause’ method—just say ‘pause’ and we’ll adjust the scene.”_

---

### **5. House Rules & Mechanics** 📜

Every DM has their own approach—Session 0 is where **house rules and gameplay clarifications are discussed**. This includes:

- **Death & Resurrection Rules** – Is dying common, or rare?
- **Critical Successes & Failures** – Do natural 1s and 20s affect skill checks?
- **Homebrew Content** – Any unique rules, abilities, or classes?
- **Resting & Healing Rules** – Short rests, long rests, and how they work in the setting.

💡 _Example:_ _“A natural 1 on an attack roll causes a fumble, possibly hitting an ally or dropping your weapon.”_

---

### **6. The Hook – Why Are We Here?** 🗺️

A campaign should begin with **a reason for the characters to adventure together**. The DM should introduce:

- **The World & Starting Location** – Where does the game begin?
- **The Initial Conflict** – What brings the characters together?
- **Factions & Politics** – Who are the major players in the world?
- **The First Adventure’s Premise** – What is the first goal, quest, or mission?

💡 _Example:_ _“You are all mercenaries, exiles, or desperate souls answering the call of a mysterious benefactor. You have been summoned to a hidden mountain stronghold, but none of you know why…”_

---

### **7. Final Questions & Agreement** ✔️

Before wrapping up Session 0, everyone should confirm:  
✅ Are we comfortable with the campaign tone and expectations?  
✅ Are our characters **ready and motivated** to adventure together?  
✅ Does everyone understand the house rules and DM rulings?  
✅ Are there **any remaining concerns or adjustments needed**?

💡 _Example:_ _“Everyone good with the character dynamics? Any last-minute tweaks before we begin next session?”_

---

### **Final Thoughts** 🎲

A **Session 0** ensures that every player is **invested in the story, comfortable at the table, and ready to have an amazing campaign**. By discussing **expectations, mechanics, and boundaries** ahead of time, everyone can focus on what truly matters—**immersing in the adventure and having fun together.**
